Pekko uses the Actor Model to provide more intuitive high-level abstractions for concurrency. Using these abstractions, Pekko also provides libraries for persistence, streams, HTTP, and more. Pekko includes APIs for Java and Scala and is designed to run in JVMs. Apache Pekko™ is a fork of Akka 2.6.x, prior to the Akka project’s adoption of the Business Source License.\nGetting Started Apache Pekko Cluster with Scala Apache Pekko Cluster with Java Apache Pekko Cluster Docker Compose with Scala Apache Pekko Cluster Docker Compose with Java Apache Pekko Distributed Data with Scala Apache Pekko Distributed Data with Java Apache Pekko Distributed Workers with Scala Apache Pekko FSM with Scala Apache Pekko FSM with Java Apache Pekko gRPC on Kubernetes (Scala) Apache Pekko Kafka to Sharding with Scala Apache Pekko Persistence with Scala Apache Pekko Persistence with Java Apache Pekko Cluster Sharding with Scala Apache Pekko Cluster Sharding with Java\nModules Apache Pekko Core Docs API Java API Apache Pekko HTTP Docs API Java API Apache Pekko gRPC Docs API Apache Pekko Connectors Docs API Apache Pekko Connectors Kafka Docs API Apache Pekko Management Docs API Apache Pekko Persistence Cassandra Docs API Apache Pekko Persistence DynamoDB GitHub Apache Pekko Persistence JDBC Docs API Apache Pekko Persistence R2DBC Docs API Apache Pekko Projection Docs API\nApache Software Foundation License Security Privacy Events Donate Thanks","title":"Apache Pekko™"},{"location":"samples.html","text":"","title":"Samples"},{"location":"samples.html#samples","text":"The samples can be download using Git from pekko-samples.\nPekko Cluster with Scala Pekko Cluster with Java Pekko Cluster Docker Compose with Scala Pekko Cluster Docker Compose with Java Pekko Distributed Data with Scala Pekko Distributed Data with Java Pekko Distributed Workers with Scala Pekko FSM with Scala Pekko FSM with Java Pekko gRPC on Kubernetes (Scala) Pekko Kafka to Sharding with Scala Pekko Persistence with Scala Pekko Persistence with Java Pekko Cluster Sharding with Scala Pekko Cluster Sharding with Java","title":"Samples"},{"location":"samples.html#help-wanted","text":"Migrating the following samples and guides from Akka to Pekko falls under the heading ‘Help Wanted’.\npekko-connectors-samples pekko-platform-guide","title":"Help Wanted"},{"location":"modules.html","text":"","title":"Modules"},{"location":"modules.html#modules","text":"pekko (core) docs api japi pekko-http docs api japi pekko-grpc docs api pekko-connectors docs api pekko-connectors-kafka docs api pekko-management docs api pekko-persistence-cassandra docs api pekko-persistence-dynamodb GitHub pekko-persistence-jdbc docs api pekko-persistence-r2dbc docs api pekko-projection docs api\nWe are still working on fixing up the docs for some Pekko modules.
