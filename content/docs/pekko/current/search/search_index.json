Pekko allows you to focus on meeting business needs instead of writing low-level code to provide reliable behavior, fault tolerance, and high performance.\nMany common practices and accepted programming models do not address important challenges inherent in designing systems for modern computer architectures. To be successful, distributed systems must cope in an environment where components crash without responding, messages get lost without a trace on the wire, and network latency fluctuates. These problems occur regularly in carefully managed intra-datacenter environments - even more so in virtualized architectures.\nTo help you deal with these realities, Pekko provides:\nMulti-threaded behavior without the use of low-level concurrency constructs like atomics or locks — relieving you from even thinking about memory visibility issues. Transparent remote communication between systems and their components — relieving you from writing and maintaining difficult networking code. A clustered, high-availability architecture that is elastic, scales in or out, on demand — enabling you to deliver a truly reactive system.\nPekko’s use of the actor model provides a level of abstraction that makes it easier to write correct concurrent, parallel and distributed systems. The actor model spans the full set of Pekko libraries, providing you with a consistent way of understanding and using them. Thus, Pekko offers a depth of integration that you cannot achieve by picking libraries to solve individual problems and trying to piece them together.\nBy learning Pekko and how to use the actor model, you will gain access to a vast and deep set of tools that solve difficult distributed/parallel systems problems in a uniform programming model where everything fits together tightly and efficiently.","title":"Introduction to Apache Pekko"},{"location":"/typed/guide/introduction.html#how-to-get-started","text":"If this is your first experience with Pekko, we recommend that you start by running a simple Hello World project.

The Quickstart guide walks you through example code that introduces how to define actor systems, actors, and messages as well as how to use the test module and logging. Within 30 minutes, you should be able to run the Hello World example and learn how it is constructed.\nThis Getting Started guide provides the next level of information. It covers why the actor model fits the needs of modern distributed systems and includes a tutorial that will help further your knowledge of Pekko.

Today, hardware and infrastructure capabilities have caught up with and exceeded Hewitt’s vision. Consequently, organizations building distributed systems with demanding requirements encounter challenges that cannot fully be solved with a traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) model, but that can benefit from the actor model.\nToday, the actor model is not only recognized as a highly effective solution — it has been proven in production for some of the world’s most demanding applications. To highlight issues that the actor model addresses, this topic discusses the following mismatches between traditional programming assumptions and the reality of modern multi-threaded, multi-CPU architectures:\nThe challenge of encapsulation The illusion of shared memory on modern computer architectures The illusion of a call stack","title":"Why modern systems need a new programming model"},{"location":"/typed/guide/actors-motivation.html#the-challenge-of-encapsulation","text":"A core pillar of OOP is encapsulation. Encapsulation dictates that the internal data of an object is not accessible directly from the outside; it can only be modified by invoking a set of curated methods. The object is responsible for exposing safe operations that protect the invariant nature of its encapsulated data.\nFor example, operations on an ordered binary tree implementation must not allow violation of the tree ordering invariant. Callers expect the ordering to be intact and when querying the tree for a certain piece of data, they need to be able to rely on this constraint.\nWhen we analyze OOP runtime behavior, we sometimes draw a message sequence chart showing the interactions of method calls. For example:\nUnfortunately, the above diagram does not accurately represent the lifelines of the instances during execution. In reality, a thread executes all these calls, and the enforcement of invariants occurs on the same thread from which the method was called. Updating the diagram with the thread of execution, it looks like this:\nThe significance of this clarification becomes clear when you try to model what happens with multiple threads. Suddenly, our neatly drawn diagram becomes inadequate. We can try to illustrate multiple threads accessing the same instance:\nThere is a section of execution where two threads enter the same method. Unfortunately, the encapsulation model of objects does not guarantee anything about what happens in that section. Instructions of the two invocations can be interleaved in arbitrary ways which eliminate any hope for keeping the invariants intact without some type of coordination between two threads. Now, imagine this issue compounded by the existence of many threads.\nThe common approach to solving this problem is to add a lock around these methods. While this ensures that at most one thread will enter the method at any given time, this is a very costly strategy:\nLocks seriously limit concurrency, they are very costly on modern CPU architectures, requiring heavy-lifting from the operating system to suspend the thread and restore it later. The caller thread is now blocked, so it cannot do any other meaningful work. Even in desktop applications this is unacceptable, we want to keep user-facing parts of applications (its UI) to be responsive even when a long background job is running. In the backend, blocking is outright wasteful. One might think that this can be compensated by launching new threads, but threads are also a costly abstraction. Locks introduce a new menace: deadlocks.\nThese realities result in a no-win situation:\nWithout sufficient locks, the state gets corrupted. With many locks in place, performance suffers and very easily leads to deadlocks.\nAdditionally, locks only really work well locally. When it comes to coordinating across multiple machines, the only alternative is distributed locks. Unfortunately, distributed locks are several magnitudes less efficient than local locks and usually impose a hard limit on scaling out. Distributed lock protocols require several communication round-trips over the network across multiple machines, so latency goes through the roof.\nIn Object Oriented languages we rarely think about threads or linear execution paths in general. We often envision a system as a network of object instances that react to method calls, modify their internal state, then communicate with each other via method calls driving the whole application state forward:\nHowever, in a multi-threaded distributed environment, what actually happens is that threads “traverse” this network of object instances by following method calls. As a result, threads are what really drive execution:\nIn summary:\nObjects can only guarantee encapsulation (protection of invariants) in the face of single-threaded access, multi-thread execution almost always leads to corrupted internal state. Every invariant can be violated by having two contending threads in the same code segment. While locks seem to be the natural remedy to uphold encapsulation with multiple threads, in practice they are inefficient and easily lead to deadlocks in any application of real-world scale. Locks work locally, attempts to make them distributed exist, but offer limited potential for scaling out.","title":"The challenge of encapsulation"},{"location":"/typed/guide/actors-motivation.html#the-illusion-of-shared-memory-on-modern-computer-architectures","text":"Programming models of the 80’-90’s conceptualize that writing to a variable means writing to a memory location directly (which somewhat muddies the water that local variables might exist only in registers). On modern architectures - if we simplify things a bit - CPUs are writing to cache lines instead of writing to memory directly. Most of these caches are local to the CPU core, that is, writes by one core are not visible by another. In order to make local changes visible to another core, and hence to another thread, the cache line needs to be shipped to the other core’s cache.\nOn the JVM, we have to explicitly denote memory locations to be shared across threads by using volatile markers or Atomic wrappers. Otherwise, we can access them only in a locked section. Why don’t we just mark all variables as volatile? Because shipping cache lines across cores is a very costly operation! Doing so would implicitly stall the cores involved from doing additional work, and result in bottlenecks on the cache coherence protocol (the protocol CPUs use to transfer cache lines between main memory and other CPUs). The result is magnitudes of slowdown.\nEven for developers aware of this situation, figuring out which memory locations should be marked as volatile, or which atomic structures to use is a dark art.\nIn summary:\nThere is no real shared memory anymore, CPU cores pass chunks of data (cache lines) explicitly to each other just as computers on a network do. Inter-CPU communication and network communication have more in common than many realize. Passing messages is the norm now be it across CPUs or networked computers. Instead of hiding the message passing aspect through variables marked as shared or using atomic data structures, a more disciplined and principled approach is to keep state local to a concurrent entity and propagate data or events between concurrent entities explicitly via messages.","title":"The illusion of shared memory on modern computer architectures"},{"location":"/typed/guide/actors-motivation.html#the-illusion-of-a-call-stack","text":"Today, we often take call stacks for granted. But, they were invented in an era where concurrent programming was not as important because multi-CPU systems were not common. Call stacks do not cross threads and hence, do not model asynchronous call chains.\nThe problem arises when a thread intends to delegate a task to the “background”. In practice, this really means delegating to another thread. This cannot be a simple method/function call because calls are strictly local to the thread. What usually happens, is that the “caller” puts an object into a memory location shared by a worker thread (“callee”), which in turn, picks it up in some event loop. This allows the “caller” thread to move on and do other tasks.\nThe first issue is, how can the “caller” be notified of the completion of the task? But a more serious issue arises when a task fails with an exception. Where does the exception propagate to? It will propagate to the exception handler of the worker thread completely ignoring who the actual “caller” was:\nThis is a serious problem. How does the worker thread deal with the situation? It likely cannot fix the issue as it is usually oblivious of the purpose of the failed task. The “caller” thread needs to be notified somehow, but there is no call stack to unwind with an exception. Failure notification can only be done via a side-channel, for example putting an error code where the “caller” thread otherwise expects the result once ready. If this notification is not in place, the “caller” never gets notified of a failure and the task is lost! This is surprisingly similar to how networked systems work where messages/requests can get lost/fail without any notification.\nThis bad situation gets worse when things go really wrong and a worker backed by a thread encounters a bug and ends up in an unrecoverable situation. For example, an internal exception caused by a bug bubbles up to the root of the thread and makes the thread shut down. This immediately raises the question, who should restart the normal operation of the service hosted by the thread, and how should it be restored to a known-good state? At first glance, this might seem manageable, but we are suddenly faced by a new, unexpected phenomena: the actual task, that the thread was currently working on, is no longer in the shared memory location where tasks are taken from (usually a queue). In fact, due to the exception reaching to the top, unwinding all of the call stack, the task state is fully lost! We have lost a message even though this is local communication with no networking involved (where message losses are to be expected).\nIn summary:\nTo achieve any meaningful concurrency and performance on current systems, threads must delegate tasks among each other in an efficient way without blocking. With this style of task-delegating concurrency (and even more so with networked/distributed computing) call stack-based error handling breaks down and new, explicit error signaling mechanisms need to be introduced. Failures become part of the domain model. Concurrent systems with work delegation need to handle service faults and have principled means to recover from them. Clients of such services need to be aware that tasks/messages might get lost during restarts. Even if loss does not happen, a response might be delayed arbitrarily due to previously enqueued tasks (a long queue), delays caused by garbage collection, etc. In face of these, concurrent systems should handle response deadlines in the form of timeouts, just like networked/distributed systems.\nNext, let’s see how use of the actor model can overcome these challenges.","title":"The illusion of a call stack"},{"location":"/typed/guide/actors-intro.html","text":"","title":"How the Actor Model Meets the Needs of Modern, Distributed Systems"},{"location":"/typed/guide/actors-intro.html#how-the-actor-model-meets-the-needs-of-modern-distributed-systems","text":"As described in the previous topic, common programming practices do not properly address the needs of demanding modern systems. Thankfully, we don’t need to scrap everything we know. Instead, the actor model addresses these shortcomings in a principled way, allowing systems to behave in a way that better matches our mental model. The actor model abstraction allows you to think about your code in terms of communication, not unlike the exchanges that occur between people in a large organization.\nUse of actors allows us to:\nEnforce encapsulation without resorting to locks. Use the model of cooperative entities reacting to signals, changing state, and sending signals to each other to drive the whole application forward. Stop worrying about an executing mechanism which is a mismatch to our world view.","title":"How the Actor Model Meets the Needs of Modern, Distributed Systems"},{"location":"/typed/guide/actors-intro.html#usage-of-message-passing-avoids-locking-and-blocking","text":"Instead of calling methods, actors send messages to each other. Sending a message does not transfer the thread of execution from the sender to the destination. An actor can send a message and continue without blocking. Therefore, it can accomplish more in the same amount of time.\nWith objects, when a method returns, it releases control of its executing thread. In this respect, actors behave much like objects, they react to messages and return execution when they finish processing the current message. In this way, actors actually achieve the execution we imagined for objects:\nAn important difference between passing messages and calling methods is that messages have no return value. By sending a message, an actor delegates work to another actor. As we saw in The illusion of a call stack, if it expected a return value, the sending actor would either need to block or to execute the other actor’s work on the same thread. Instead, the receiving actor delivers the results in a reply message.\nThe second key change we need in our model is to reinstate encapsulation. Actors react to messages just like objects “react” to methods invoked on them. The difference is that instead of multiple threads “protruding” into our actor and wreaking havoc to internal state and invariants, actors execute independently from the senders of a message, and they react to incoming messages sequentially, one at a time. While each actor processes messages sent to it sequentially, different actors work concurrently with each other so that an actor system can process as many messages simultaneously as the hardware will support.\nSince there is always at most one message being processed per actor, the invariants of an actor can be kept without synchronization. This happens automatically without using locks:\nIn summary, this is what happens when an actor receives a message:\nThe actor adds the message to the end of a queue. If the actor was not scheduled for execution, it is marked as ready to execute. A (hidden) scheduler entity takes the actor and starts executing it. Actor picks the message from the front of the queue. Actor modifies internal state, sends messages to other actors. The actor is unscheduled.\nTo accomplish this behavior, actors have:\nA mailbox (the queue where messages end up). A behavior (the state of the actor, internal variables etc.). Messages (pieces of data representing a signal, similar to method calls and their parameters). An execution environment (the machinery that takes actors that have messages to react to and invokes their message handling code). An address (more on this later).\nMessages go into actor mailboxes. The behavior of the actor describes how the actor responds to messages (like sending more messages and/or changing state). An execution environment orchestrates a pool of threads to drive all these actions completely transparently.\nThis is a very simple model and it solves the issues enumerated previously:\nEncapsulation is preserved by decoupling execution from signaling (method calls transfer execution, message passing does not). There is no need for locks. Modifying the internal state of an actor is only possible via messages, which are processed one at a time eliminating races when trying to keep invariants. There are no locks used anywhere, and senders are not blocked. Millions of actors can be efficiently scheduled on a dozen of threads reaching the full potential of modern CPUs. Task delegation is the natural mode of operation for actors. State of actors is local and not shared, changes and data is propagated via messages, which maps to how modern memory hierarchy actually works. In many cases, this means transferring over only the cache lines that contain the data in the message while keeping local state and data cached at the original core. The same model maps exactly to remote communication where the state is kept in the RAM of machines and changes/data is propagated over the network as packets.","title":"Usage of message passing avoids locking and blocking"},{"location":"/typed/guide/actors-intro.html#actors-handle-error-situations-gracefully","text":"Since we no longer have a shared call stack between actors that send messages to each other, we need to handle error situations differently. There are two kinds of errors we need to consider:\nThe first case is when the delegated task on the target actor failed due to an error in the task (typically some validation issue, like a non-existent user ID). In this case, the service encapsulated by the target actor is intact, it is only the task itself that is erroneous. The service actor should reply to the sender with a message, presenting the error case. There is nothing special here, errors are part of the domain and hence become ordinary messages. The second case is when a service itself encounters an internal fault. Pekko enforces that all actors are organized into a tree-like hierarchy, i.e. an actor that creates another actor becomes the parent of that new actor. This is very similar to how operating systems organize processes into a tree. Just like with processes, when an actor fails, its parent actor can decide how to react to the failure. Also, if the parent actor is stopped, all of its children are recursively stopped, too. This service is called supervision and it is central to Pekko.\nA supervisor strategy is typically defined by the parent actor when it is starting a child actor. It can decide to restart the child actor on certain types of failures or stop it completely on others. Children never go silently dead (with the notable exception of entering an infinite loop) instead they are either failing and the supervisor strategy can react to the fault, or they are stopped (in which case interested parties are notified). There is always a responsible entity for managing an actor: its parent. Restarts are not visible from the outside: collaborating actors can keep sending messages while the target actor restarts.\nNow, let’s take a short tour of the functionality Pekko provides.","title":"Actors handle error situations gracefully"},{"location":"/typed/guide/modules.html","text":"","title":"Overview of Apache Pekko libraries and modules"},{"location":"/typed/guide/modules.html#overview-of-apache-pekko-libraries-and-modules","text":"Before delving into some best practices for writing actors, it will be helpful to preview the most commonly used Pekko libraries.

From a birds-eye view, actors are a programming paradigm that takes encapsulation, one of the pillars of OOP, to its extreme. Unlike objects, actors encapsulate not only their state but their execution. Communication with actors is not via method calls but by passing messages. While this difference may seem minor, it is actually what allows us to break clean from the limitations of OOP when it comes to concurrency and remote communication. Don’t worry if this description feels too high level to fully grasp yet, in the next chapter we will explain actors in detail. For now, the important point is that this is a model that handles concurrency and distribution at the fundamental level instead of ad hoc patched attempts to bring these features to OOP.\nChallenges that actors solve include the following:\nHow to build and design high-performance, concurrent applications.

While distributed as a JAR artifact, Remoting resembles a module more than it does a library. You enable it mostly with configuration and it has only a few APIs. Thanks to the actor model, a remote and local message send looks exactly the same. The patterns that you use on local systems translate directly to remote systems. You will rarely need to use Remoting directly, but it provides the foundation on which the Cluster subsystem is built.\nChallenges Remoting solves include the following:\nHow to address actor systems living on remote hosts.

While Remoting solves the problem of addressing and communicating with components of remote systems, Clustering gives you the ability to organize these into a “meta-system” tied together by a membership protocol. In most cases, you want to use the Cluster module instead of using Remoting directly. Clustering provides an additional set of services on top of Remoting that most real world applications need.\nChallenges the Cluster module solves include the following:\nHow to maintain a set of actor systems (a cluster) that can communicate with each other and consider each other as part of the cluster. How to introduce a new system safely to the set of already existing members. How to reliably detect systems that are temporarily unreachable.

Cluster singleton allows a cluster to select an actor system which will host a particular actor while other systems can always access said service independently from where it is.\nThe Singleton module can be used to solve these challenges:\nHow to ensure that only one instance of a service is running in the whole cluster.

Very common is the scenario where a chain, or graph, of actors, need to process a potentially large, or infinite, stream of sequential events and properly coordinate resource usage so that faster processing stages do not overwhelm slower ones in the chain or graph. Streams provide a higher-level abstraction on top of actors that simplifies writing such processing networks, handling all the fine details in the background and providing a safe, typed, composable programming model.

You create an actor by calling ActorContext.spawn()ActorContext.spawn(). The creator actor becomes the parent of the newly created child actor. You might ask then, who is the parent of the first actor you create?\nAs illustrated below, all actors have a common parent, the user guardian, which is defined and created when you start the ActorSystemActorSystem. As we covered in the Quickstart GuideQuickstart Guide, creation of an actor returns a reference that is a valid URL. So, for example, if we create an actor named someActor from the user guardian with context.spawn(someBehavior, \"someActor\"), its reference will include the path /user/someActor.\nIn fact, before your first actor is started, Pekko has already created two actors in the system. The names of these built-in actors contain guardian. The guardian actors include:\n/ the so-called root guardian. This is the parent of all actors in the system, and the last one to stop when the system itself is terminated. /system the system guardian. Pekko or other libraries built on top of Pekko may create actors in the system namespace. /user the user guardian. This is the top level actor that you provide to start all other actors in your application.\nThe easiest way to see the actor hierarchy in action is to print ActorRefActorRef instances. In this small experiment, we create an actor, print its reference, create a child of this actor, and print the child’s reference.\nIn a new project, create a com.example package and with a a new Scala file called ActorHierarchyExperiments.scala here.

We sent the message by using the parent’s reference: firstRef ! \"printit\"firstRef.tell(\"printit\", ActorRef.noSender()). When the code executes, the output includes the references for the first actor and the child it created as part of the printit case. Your output should look similar to the following:\nFirst: Actor[pekko://testSystem/user/first-actor#1053618476]\nSecond: Actor[pekko://testSystem/user/first-actor/second-actor#-1544706041]\nNotice the structure of the references:\nBoth paths start with pekko://testSystem/. Since all actor references are valid URLs, pekko:// is the value of the protocol field. Next, just like on the World Wide Web, the URL identifies the system. In this example, the system is named testSystem, but it could be any other name. If remote communication between multiple systems is enabled, this part of the URL includes the hostname so other systems can find it on the network. Because the second actor’s reference includes the path /first-actor/, it identifies it as a child of the first. The last part of the actor reference, #1053618476 or #-1544706041 is a unique identifier that you can ignore in most cases.\nNow that you understand what the actor hierarchy looks like, you might be wondering: Why do we need this hierarchy? What is it used for?\nAn important role of the hierarchy is to safely manage actor lifecycles. Let’s consider this next and see how that knowledge can help us write better code.","title":"The Pekko actor hierarchy"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_1.html#the-actor-lifecycle","text":"Actors pop into existence when created, then later, at user requests, they are stopped. Whenever an actor is stopped, all of its children are recursively stopped too. This behavior greatly simplifies resource cleanup and helps avoid resource leaks such as those caused by open sockets and files. In fact, a commonly overlooked difficulty when dealing with low-level multi-threaded code is the lifecycle management of various concurrent resources.\nTo stop an actor, the recommended pattern is to return Behaviors.stoppedBehaviors.stopped inside the actor to stop itself, usually as a response to some user defined stop message or when the actor is done with its job. Stopping a child actor is technically possible by calling context.stop(childRef)context.stop(childRef) from the parent, but it’s not possible to stop arbitrary (non-child) actors this way.\nThe Pekko actor API exposes some lifecycle signals, for example PostStopPostStop is sent just after the actor has been stopped. No messages are processed after this point.\nLet’s use the PostStop lifecycle signal in a simple experiment to observe the behavior when we stop an actor. First, add the following 2 actor classes to your project:\nScala copysourceobject StartStopActor1 {\n  def apply(): Behavior[String] =\n    Behaviors.setup(context => new StartStopActor1(context))\n}\n\nclass StartStopActor1(context: ActorContext[String]) extends AbstractBehavior[String](context) {\n  println(\"first started\")\n  context.spawn(StartStopActor2(), \"second\")\n\n  override def onMessage(msg: String): Behavior[String] =\n    msg match {\n      case \"stop\" => Behaviors.stopped\n    }\n\n  override def onSignal: PartialFunction[Signal, Behavior[String]] = {\n    case PostStop =>\n      println(\"first stopped\")\n      this\n  }\n\n}\n\nobject StartStopActor2 {\n  def apply(): Behavior[String] =\n    Behaviors.setup(new StartStopActor2(_))\n}\n\nclass StartStopActor2(context: ActorContext[String]) extends AbstractBehavior[String](context) {\n  println(\"second started\")\n\n  override def onMessage(msg: String): Behavior[String] = {\n    // no messages handled by this actor\n    Behaviors.unhandled\n  }\n\n  override def onSignal: PartialFunction[Signal, Behavior[String]] = {\n    case PostStop =>\n      println(\"second stopped\")\n      this\n  }\n\n} Java copysourceclass StartStopActor1 extends AbstractBehavior<String> {\n\n  static Behavior<String> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(StartStopActor1::new);\n  }\n\n  private StartStopActor1(ActorContext<String> context) {\n    super(context);\n    System.out.println(\"first started\");\n\n    context.spawn(StartStopActor2.create(), \"second\");\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<String> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder()\n        .onMessageEquals(\"stop\", Behaviors::stopped)\n        .onSignal(PostStop.class, signal -> onPostStop())\n        .build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<String> onPostStop() {\n    System.out.println(\"first stopped\");\n    return this;\n  }\n}\n\nclass StartStopActor2 extends AbstractBehavior<String> {\n\n  static Behavior<String> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(StartStopActor2::new);\n  }\n\n  private StartStopActor2(ActorContext<String> context) {\n    super(context);\n    System.out.println(\"second started\");\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<String> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder().onSignal(PostStop.class, signal -> onPostStop()).build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<String> onPostStop() {\n    System.out.println(\"second stopped\");\n    return this;\n  }\n}\nAnd create a ‘main’ class like above to start the actors and then send them a \"stop\" message:\nScala copysourceval first = context.spawn(StartStopActor1(), \"first\")\nfirst ! \"stop\" Java copysourceActorRef<String> first = context.spawn(StartStopActor1.create(), \"first\");\nfirst.tell(\"stop\");\nYou can again use sbt to start this program. The output should look like this:\nfirst started\nsecond started\nsecond stopped\nfirst stopped\nWhen we stopped actor first, it stopped its child actor, second, before stopping itself. This ordering is strict, all PostStopPostStop signals of the children are processed before the PostStop signal of the parent is processed.","title":"The actor lifecycle"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_1.html#failure-handling","text":"Parents and children are connected throughout their lifecycles. Whenever an actor fails (throws an exception or an unhandled exception bubbles out from onMessageReceive) the failure information is propagated to the supervision strategy, which then decides how to handle the exception caused by the actor. The supervision strategy is typically defined by the parent actor when it spawns a child actor. In this way, parents act as supervisors for their children. The default supervisor strategy is to stop the child. If you don’t define the strategy all failures result in a stop.\nLet’s observe a restart supervision strategy in a simple experiment.

In this part, we will look at actors in the small by implementing the device actor.\nIf we were working with objects, we would typically design the API as interfaces, a collection of abstract methods to be filled out by the actual implementation. In the world of actors, protocols take the place of interfaces. While it is not possible to formalize general protocols in the programming language, we can compose their most basic element, messages. So, we will start by identifying the messages we will want to send to device actors.\nTypically, messages fall into categories, or patterns. By identifying these patterns, you will find that it becomes easier to choose between them and to implement them. The first example demonstrates the request-respond message pattern.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_3.html#identifying-messages-for-devices","text":"The tasks of a device actor will be simple:\nCollect temperature measurements When asked, report the last measured temperature\nHowever, a device might start without immediately having a temperature measurement. Hence, we need to account for the case where a temperature is not present. This also allows us to test the query part of the actor without the write part present, as the device actor can report an empty result.\nThe protocol for obtaining the current temperature from the device actor is simple. The actor:\nWaits for a request for the current temperature. Responds to the request with a reply that either: contains the current temperature or, indicates that a temperature is not yet available.\nWe need two messages, one for the request, and one for the reply. Our first attempt might look like the following:\nScala copysourcepackage com.example\n\n  import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.ActorRef\n\n  object Device {\n    sealed trait Command\n    final case class ReadTemperature(replyTo: ActorRef[RespondTemperature]) extends Command\n    final case class RespondTemperature(value: Option[Double])\n  } Java copysourcepackage com.example;\n\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.ActorRef;\nimport java.util.Optional;\n\npublic class Device {\n\n  public interface Command {}\n\n  public static final class ReadTemperature implements Command {\n    final ActorRef<RespondTemperature> replyTo;\n\n    public ReadTemperature(ActorRef<RespondTemperature> replyTo) {\n      this.replyTo = replyTo;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public static final class RespondTemperature {\n    final Optional<Double> value;\n\n    public RespondTemperature(Optional<Double> value) {\n      this.value = value;\n    }\n  }\n}\nNote that the ReadTemperature message contains the ActorRef[RespondTemperature]ActorRef<RespondTemperature> that the device actor will use when replying to the request.\nThese two messages seem to cover the required functionality. However, the approach we choose must take into account the distributed nature of the application. While the basic mechanism is the same for communicating with an actor on the local JVM as with a remote actor, we need to keep the following in mind:\nThere will be observable differences in the latency of delivery between local and remote messages, because factors like network link bandwidth and the message size also come into play. Reliability is a concern because a remote message send involves more steps, which means that more can go wrong. A local send will pass a reference to the message inside the same JVM, without any restrictions on the underlying object which is sent, whereas a remote transport will place a limit on the message size.\nIn addition, while sending inside the same JVM is significantly more reliable, if an actor fails due to a programmer error while processing the message, the effect is the same as if a remote network request fails due to the remote host crashing while processing the message. Even though in both cases, the service recovers after a while (the actor is restarted by its supervisor, the host is restarted by an operator or by a monitoring system) individual requests are lost during the crash. Therefore, writing your actors such that every message could possibly be lost is the safe, pessimistic bet.\nBut to further understand the need for flexibility in the protocol, it will help to consider Pekko message ordering and message delivery guarantees. Pekko provides the following behavior for message sends:\nAt-most-once delivery, that is, no guaranteed delivery. Message ordering is maintained per sender, receiver pair.\nThe following sections discuss this behavior in more detail:\nMessage delivery Message ordering","title":"Identifying messages for devices"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_3.html#message-delivery","text":"The delivery semantics provided by messaging subsystems typically fall into the following categories:\nAt-most-once delivery — each message is delivered zero or one time; in more causal terms it means that messages can be lost, but are never duplicated. At-least-once delivery — potentially multiple attempts are made to deliver each message, until at least one succeeds; again, in more causal terms this means that messages can be duplicated but are never lost. Exactly-once delivery — each message is delivered exactly once to the recipient; the message can neither be lost nor be duplicated.\nThe first behavior, the one used by Pekko, is the cheapest and results in the highest performance. It has the least implementation overhead because it can be done in a fire-and-forget fashion without keeping the state at the sending end or in the transport mechanism. The second, at-least-once, requires retries to counter transport losses. This adds the overhead of keeping the state at the sending end and having an acknowledgment mechanism at the receiving end. Exactly-once delivery is most expensive, and results in the worst performance: in addition to the overhead added by at-least-once delivery, it requires the state to be kept at the receiving end in order to filter out duplicate deliveries.\nIn an actor system, we need to determine exact meaning of a guarantee — at which point does the system consider the delivery as accomplished:\nWhen the message is sent out on the network? When the message is received by the target actor’s host? When the message is put into the target actor’s mailbox? When the message target actor starts to process the message? When the target actor has successfully processed the message?\nMost frameworks and protocols that claim guaranteed delivery actually provide something similar to points 4 and 5. While this sounds reasonable, is it actually useful? To understand the implications, consider a simple, practical example: a user attempts to place an order and we only want to claim that it has successfully processed once it is actually on disk in the orders database.\nIf we rely on the successful processing of the message, the actor will report success as soon as the order has been submitted to the internal API that has the responsibility to validate it, process it and put it into the database. Unfortunately, immediately after the API has been invoked any of the following can happen:\nThe host can crash. Deserialization can fail. Validation can fail. The database might be unavailable. A programming error might occur.\nThis illustrates that the guarantee of delivery does not translate to the domain level guarantee. We only want to report success once the order has been actually fully processed and persisted. The only entity that can report success is the application itself, since only it has any understanding of the domain guarantees required. No generalized framework can figure out the specifics of a particular domain and what is considered a success in that domain.\nIn this particular example, we only want to signal success after a successful database write, where the database acknowledged that the order is now safely stored. For these reasons Pekko lifts the responsibilities of guarantees to the application itself, i.e. you have to implement them yourself with the tools that Pekko provides. This gives you full control of the guarantees that you want to provide. Now, let’s consider the message ordering that Pekko provides to make it easy to reason about application logic.","title":"Message delivery"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_3.html#message-ordering","text":"In Pekko, for a given pair of actors, messages sent directly from the first to the second will not be received out-of-order. The word directly emphasizes that this guarantee only applies when sending with the tell operator directly to the final destination, but not when employing mediators.\nIf:\nActor A1 sends messages M1, M2, M3 to A2. Actor A3 sends messages M4, M5, M6 to A2.\nThis means that, for Pekko messages:\nIf M1 is delivered it must be delivered before M2 and M3. If M2 is delivered it must be delivered before M3. If M4 is delivered it must be delivered before M5 and M6. If M5 is delivered it must be delivered before M6. A2 can see messages from A1 interleaved with messages from A3. Since there is no guaranteed delivery, any of the messages may be dropped, i.e. not arrive at A2.\nThese guarantees strike a good balance: having messages from one actor arrive in-order is convenient for building systems that can be easily reasoned about, while on the other hand allowing messages from different actors to arrive interleaved provides sufficient freedom for an efficient implementation of the actor system.\nFor the full details on delivery guarantees please refer to the reference page.","title":"Message Ordering"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_3.html#adding-flexibility-to-device-messages","text":"Our first query protocol was correct, but did not take into account distributed application execution.

In a complete IoT system for monitoring home temperatures, the steps for connecting a device sensor to our system might look like this:\nA sensor device in the home connects through some protocol. The component managing network connections accepts the connection. The sensor provides its group and device ID to register with the device manager component of our system. The device manager component handles registration by looking up or creating the actor responsible for keeping sensor state. The actor responds with an acknowledgement, exposing its ActorRefActorRef. The networking component now uses the ActorRef for communication between the sensor and device actor without going through the device manager.\nSteps 1 and 2 take place outside the boundaries of our tutorial system. In this chapter, we will start addressing steps 3-6 and create a way for sensors to register with our system and to communicate with actors. But first, we have another architectural decision — how many levels of actors should we use to represent device groups and device sensors?\nOne of the main design challenges for Pekko programmers is choosing the best granularity for actors. In practice, depending on the characteristics of the interactions between actors, there are usually several valid ways to organize a system. In our use case, for example, it would be possible to have a single actor maintain all the groups and devices — perhaps using hash maps. It would also be reasonable to have an actor for each group that tracks the state of all devices in the same home.\nThe following guidelines help us choose the most appropriate actor hierarchy:\nIn general, prefer larger granularity. Introducing more fine-grained actors than needed causes more problems than it solves. Add finer granularity when the system requires: Higher concurrency. Complex conversations between actors that have many states. We will see a very good example for this in the next chapter. Sufficient state that it makes sense to divide into smaller actors. Multiple unrelated responsibilities. Using separate actors allows individuals to fail and be restored with little impact on others.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_4.html#device-manager-hierarchy","text":"Considering the principles outlined in the previous section, We will model the device manager component as an actor tree with three levels:\nThe top level supervisor actor represents the system component for devices. It is also the entry point to look up and create device group and device actors. At the next level, group actors each supervise the device actors for one group id (e.g. one home). They also provide services, such as querying temperature readings from all of the available devices in their group. Device actors manage all the interactions with the actual device sensors, such as storing temperature readings.\nWe chose this three-layered architecture for these reasons:\nHaving groups of individual actors: Isolates failures that occur in a group. If a single actor managed all device groups, an error in one group that causes a restart would wipe out the state of groups that are otherwise non-faulty. Simplifies the problem of querying all the devices belonging to a group. Each group actor only contains state related to its group. Increases parallelism in the system. Since each group has a dedicated actor, they run concurrently and we can query multiple groups concurrently. Having sensors modeled as individual device actors: Isolates failures of one device actor from the rest of the devices in the group. Increases the parallelism of collecting temperature readings. Network connections from different sensors communicate with their individual device actors directly, reducing contention points.\nWith the architecture defined, we can start working on the protocol for registering sensors.","title":"Device manager hierarchy"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_4.html#the-registration-protocol","text":"As the first step, we need to design the protocol both for registering a device and for creating the group and device actors that will be responsible for it. This protocol will be provided by the DeviceManager component itself because that is the only actor that is known and available up front: device groups and device actors are created on-demand.\nLooking at registration in more detail, we can outline the necessary functionality:\nWhen a DeviceManager receives a request with a group and device id: If the manager already has an actor for the device group, it forwards the request to it. Otherwise, it creates a new device group actor and then forwards the request. The DeviceGroup actor receives the request to register an actor for the given device: If the group already has an actor for the device it replies with the ActorRefActorRef of the existing device actor. Otherwise, the DeviceGroup actor first creates a device actor and replies with the ActorRef of the newly created device actor. The sensor will now have the ActorRef of the device actor to send messages directly to it.\nThe messages that we will use to communicate registration requests and their acknowledgement have the definition:\nScala copysourcefinal case class RequestTrackDevice(groupId: String, deviceId: String, replyTo: ActorRef[DeviceRegistered])\n    extends DeviceManager.Command\n    with DeviceGroup.Command\n\nfinal case class DeviceRegistered(device: ActorRef[Device.Command]) Java copysourcepublic class DeviceManager extends AbstractBehavior<DeviceManager.Command> {\n\n  public interface Command {}\n\n  public static final class RequestTrackDevice\n      implements DeviceManager.Command, DeviceGroup.Command {\n    public final String groupId;\n    public final String deviceId;\n    public final ActorRef<DeviceRegistered> replyTo;\n\n    public RequestTrackDevice(String groupId, String deviceId, ActorRef<DeviceRegistered> replyTo) {\n      this.groupId = groupId;\n      this.deviceId = deviceId;\n      this.replyTo = replyTo;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public static final class DeviceRegistered {\n    public final ActorRef<Device.Command> device;\n\n    public DeviceRegistered(ActorRef<Device.Command> device) {\n      this.device = device;\n    }\n  }\n}\nIn this case we have not included a request ID field in the messages. Since registration happens once, when the component connects the system to some network protocol, the ID is not important. However, it is usually a best practice to include a request ID.\nNow, we’ll start implementing the protocol from the bottom up. In practice, both a top-down and bottom-up approach can work, but in our case, we benefit from the bottom-up approach as it allows us to immediately write tests for the new features without mocking out parts that we will need to build later.","title":"The Registration Protocol"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_4.html#adding-registration-support-to-device-group-actors","text":"A group actor has some work to do when it comes to registrations, including:\nHandling the registration request for existing device actor or by creating a new actor.

Devices come and go, however, so we will need a way to remove device actors from the Map[String, ActorRef[DeviceMessage]]Map<String, ActorRef<DeviceMessage>>. We will assume that when a device is removed, its corresponding device actor is stopped. Supervision, as we discussed earlier, only handles error scenarios — not graceful stopping. So we need to notify the parent when one of the device actors is stopped.\nPekko provides a Death Watch feature that allows an actor to watch another actor and be notified if the other actor is stopped. Unlike supervision, watching is not limited to parent-child relationships, any actor can watch any other actor as long as it knows the ActorRefActorRef. After a watched actor stops, the watcher receives a Terminated(actorRef)Terminated(actorRef) signal which also contains the reference to the watched actor. The watcher can either handle this message explicitly or will fail with a DeathPactExceptionDeathPactException. This latter is useful if the actor can no longer perform its own duties after the watched actor has been stopped. In our case, the group should still function after one device have been stopped, so we need to handle the Terminated(actorRef) signal.\nOur device group actor needs to include functionality that:\nStarts watching new device actors when they are created. Removes a device actor from the Map[String, ActorRef[DeviceMessage]]Map<String, ActorRef<DeviceMessage>> — which maps devices to device actors — when the notification indicates it has stopped.\nUnfortunately, the Terminated signal only contains the ActorRef of the child actor. We need the actor’s ID to remove it from the map of existing device to device actor mappings. An alternative to the Terminated signal is to define a custom message that will be sent when the watched actor is stopped. We will use that here because it gives us the possibility to carry the device ID in that message.\nAdding the functionality to identify the actor results in this:\nScala copysource class DeviceGroup(context: ActorContext[DeviceGroup.Command], groupId: String)\n    extends AbstractBehavior[DeviceGroup.Command](context) {\n  import DeviceGroup._\n  import DeviceManager.{ DeviceRegistered, ReplyDeviceList, RequestDeviceList, RequestTrackDevice }\n\n  private var deviceIdToActor = Map.empty[String, ActorRef[Device.Command]]\n\n  context.log.info(\"DeviceGroup {} started\", groupId)\n\n  override def onMessage(msg: Command): Behavior[Command] =\n    msg match {\n      case trackMsg @ RequestTrackDevice(`groupId`, deviceId, replyTo) =>\n        deviceIdToActor.get(deviceId) match {\n          case Some(deviceActor) =>\n            replyTo !

Since homeowners will be interested in the temperatures throughout their home, our goal is to be able to query all of the device actors in a group. Let us start by investigating how such a query API should behave.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_5.html#dealing-with-possible-scenarios","text":"The very first issue we face is that the membership of a group is dynamic. Each sensor device is represented by an actor that can stop at any time. At the beginning of the query, we can ask all of the existing device actors for the current temperature. However, during the lifecycle of the query:\nA device actor might stop and not be able to respond back with a temperature reading. A new device actor might start up and not be included in the query because we weren’t aware of it.\nThese issues can be addressed in many different ways, but the important point is to settle on the desired behavior. The following works well for our use case:\nWhen a query arrives, the group actor takes a snapshot of the existing device actors and will only ask those actors for the temperature. Actors that start up after the query arrives are ignored. If an actor in the snapshot stops during the query without answering, we will report the fact that it stopped to the sender of the query message.\nApart from device actors coming and going dynamically, some actors might take a long time to answer. For example, they could be stuck in an accidental infinite loop, or fail due to a bug and drop our request. We don’t want the query to continue indefinitely, so we will consider it complete in either of the following cases:\nAll actors in the snapshot have either responded or have confirmed being stopped. We reach a pre-defined deadline.\nGiven these decisions, along with the fact that a device in the snapshot might have just started and not yet received a temperature to record, we can define four states for each device actor, with respect to a temperature query:\nIt has a temperature available: Temperature. It has responded, but has no temperature available yet: TemperatureNotAvailable. It has stopped before answering: DeviceNotAvailable. It did not respond before the deadline: DeviceTimedOut.\nSummarizing these in message types we can add the following to the message protocol:\nScala copysource final case class RequestAllTemperatures(requestId: Long, groupId: String, replyTo: ActorRef[RespondAllTemperatures])\n    extends DeviceGroupQuery.Command\n    with DeviceGroup.Command\n    with DeviceManager.Command\n\nfinal case class RespondAllTemperatures(requestId: Long, temperatures: Map[String, TemperatureReading])\n\nsealed trait TemperatureReading\nfinal case class Temperature(value: Double) extends TemperatureReading\ncase object TemperatureNotAvailable extends TemperatureReading\ncase object DeviceNotAvailable extends TemperatureReading\ncase object DeviceTimedOut extends TemperatureReading Java copysource public static final class RequestAllTemperatures\n    implements DeviceGroupQuery.Command, DeviceGroup.Command, Command {\n\n  final long requestId;\n  final String groupId;\n  final ActorRef<RespondAllTemperatures> replyTo;\n\n  public RequestAllTemperatures(\n      long requestId, String groupId, ActorRef<RespondAllTemperatures> replyTo) {\n    this.requestId = requestId;\n    this.groupId = groupId;\n    this.replyTo = replyTo;\n  }\n}\n\npublic static final class RespondAllTemperatures {\n  final long requestId;\n  final Map<String, TemperatureReading> temperatures;\n\n  public RespondAllTemperatures(long requestId, Map<String, TemperatureReading> temperatures) {\n    this.requestId = requestId;\n    this.temperatures = temperatures;\n  }\n}\n\npublic interface TemperatureReading {}\n\npublic static final class Temperature implements TemperatureReading {\n  public final double value;\n\n  public Temperature(double value) {\n    this.value = value;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n\n    Temperature that = (Temperature) o;\n\n    return Double.compare(that.value, value) == 0;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int hashCode() {\n    long temp = Double.doubleToLongBits(value);\n    return (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n    return \"Temperature{\" + \"value=\" + value + '}';\n  }\n}\n\npublic enum TemperatureNotAvailable implements TemperatureReading {\n  INSTANCE\n}\n\npublic enum DeviceNotAvailable implements TemperatureReading {\n  INSTANCE\n}\n\npublic enum DeviceTimedOut implements TemperatureReading {\n  INSTANCE\n}","title":"Dealing with possible scenarios"},{"location":"/typed/guide/tutorial_5.html#implementing-the-query","text":"One approach for implementing the query involves adding code to the device group actor. However, in practice this can be very cumbersome and error-prone. Remember that when we start a query, we need to take a snapshot of the devices present and start a timer so that we can enforce the deadline. In the meantime, another query can arrive. For the second query we need to keep track of the exact same information but in isolation from the previous query. This would require us to maintain separate mappings between queries and device actors.\nInstead, we will implement a simpler, and superior approach. We will create an actor that represents a single query and that performs the tasks needed to complete the query on behalf of the group actor. So far we have created actors that belonged to classical domain objects, but now, we will create an actor that represents a process or a task rather than an entity.

We create a simple message CollectionTimeout without any parameters for this purpose.\nAt the start of the query, we need to ask each of the device actors for the current temperature. To be able to quickly detect devices that stopped before they got the ReadTemperature message we will also watch each of the actors.

By keeping the temporary state that is only relevant to the query itself in a separate actor we keep the group actor implementation very simple. It delegates everything to child actors and therefore does not have to keep state that is not relevant to its core business. Also, multiple queries can now run parallel to each other, in fact, as many as needed. In our case querying an individual device actor is a fast operation, but if this were not the case, for example, because the remote sensors need to be contacted over the network, this design would significantly improve throughput.\nWe close this chapter by testing that everything works together.

Typical scenario is the case of a naive scheduling algorithm that always selects high-priority tasks over low-priority ones. If the number of incoming high-priority tasks is constantly high enough, no low-priority ones will be ever finished.\nLivelock is similar to deadlock as none of the participants make progress. The difference though is that instead of being frozen in a state of waiting for others to progress, the participants continuously change their state. An example scenario when two participants have two identical resources available. They each try to get the resource, but they also check if the other needs the resource, too. If the resource is requested by the other participant, they try to get the other instance of the resource.

As the packets might potentially travel via different network routes, it is possible that the server receives P2 first and P1 afterwards. If the messages contain no information about their sending order it is impossible to determine by the server that they were sent in a different order.

One actor, which is to oversee a certain function in the program might want to split up its task into smaller, more manageable pieces. For this purpose, it starts child actors.\nThe quintessential feature of actor systems is that tasks are split up and delegated until they become small enough to be handled in one piece. In doing so, not only is the task itself clearly structured, but the resulting actors can be reasoned about in terms of which messages they should process, how they should react normally and how failure should be handled.\nCompare this to layered software design which easily devolves into defensive programming with the aim of not leaking any failure out: if the problem is communicated to the right person, a better solution can be found than if trying to keep everything “under the carpet”.\nNow, the difficulty in designing such a system is how to decide how to structure the work. There is no single best solution, but there are a few guidelines which might be helpful:\nIf one actor carries very important data (i.e. its state shall not be lost if avoidable), this actor should source out any possibly dangerous sub-tasks to children and handle failures of these children as appropriate. Depending on the nature of the requests, it may be best to create a new child for each request, which simplifies state management for collecting the replies. This is known as the “Error Kernel Pattern” from Erlang. If one actor depends on another actor for carrying out its duty, it should watch that other actor’s liveness and act upon receiving a termination notice.

Actors should not block (i.e. passively wait while occupying a Thread) on some external entity—which might be a lock, a network socket, etc.—unless it is unavoidable; in the latter case see Blocking Needs Careful Management. Do not pass mutable objects between actors. In order to ensure that, prefer immutable messages. If the encapsulation of actors is broken by exposing their mutable state to the outside, you are back in normal Java concurrency land with all the drawbacks. Actors are made to be containers for behavior and state, embracing this means to not routinely send behavior within messages (which may be tempting using Scala closures). One of the risks is to accidentally share mutable state between actors, and this violation of the actor model unfortunately breaks all the properties which make programming in actors such a nice experience. The top-level actor of the actor system is the innermost part of your Error Kernel, it should only be responsible for starting the various sub systems of your application, and not contain much logic in itself, prefer truly hierarchical systems.

This section looks at one such actor in isolation, explaining the concepts you encounter while implementing it. For a more in depth reference with all the details, please refer to Introduction to Actors.\nThe Actor Model as defined by Hewitt, Bishop and Steiger in 1973 is a computational model that expresses exactly what it means for computation to be distributed. The processing units—Actors—can only communicate by exchanging messages and upon reception of a message an Actor can do the following three fundamental actions:\nsend a finite number of messages to Actors it knows create a finite number of new Actors designate the behavior to be applied to the next message\nAn actor is a container for State, Behavior, a Mailbox, Child Actors and a Supervisor Strategy. All of this is encapsulated behind an Actor Reference. One noteworthy aspect is that actors have an explicit lifecycle, they are not automatically destroyed when no longer referenced; after having created one, it is your responsibility to make sure that it will eventually be terminated as well—which also gives you control over how resources are released When an Actor Terminates.","title":"What is an Actor?"},{"location":"/general/actors.html#actor-reference","text":"As detailed below, an actor object needs to be shielded from the outside in order to benefit from the actor model. Therefore, actors are represented to the outside using actor references, which are objects that can be passed around freely and without restriction. This split into inner and outer object enables transparency for all the desired operations: restarting an actor without needing to update references elsewhere, placing the actual actor object on remote hosts, sending messages to actors independent of where they are running. But the most important aspect is that it is not possible to look inside an actor and get hold of its state from the outside, unless the actor unwisely publishes this information itself.\nActor references are parameterized and only messages that are of the specified type can be sent to them.","title":"Actor Reference"},{"location":"/general/actors.html#state","text":"Actor objects will typically contain some variables which reflect possible states the actor may be in. This can be an explicit state machine, or it could be a counter, set of listeners, pending requests, etc. These data are what make an actor valuable, and they must be protected from corruption by other actors. The good news is that Pekko actors conceptually each have their own light-weight thread, which is completely shielded from the rest of the system. This means that instead of having to synchronize access using locks you can write your actor code without worrying about concurrency at all.\nBehind the scenes Pekko will run sets of actors on sets of real threads, where typically many actors share one thread, and subsequent invocations of one actor may end up being processed on different threads. Pekko ensures that this implementation detail does not affect the single-threadedness of handling the actor’s state.\nBecause the internal state is vital to an actor’s operations, having inconsistent state is fatal. Thus, when the actor fails and is restarted by its supervisor, the state will be created from scratch, like upon first creating the actor. This is to enable the ability of self-healing of the system.\nOptionally, an actor’s state can be automatically recovered to the state before a restart by persisting received messages and replaying them after restart (see Event Sourcing).","title":"State"},{"location":"/general/actors.html#behavior","text":"Every time a message is processed, it is matched against the current behavior of the actor. Behavior means a function which defines the actions to be taken in reaction to the message at that point in time, say forward a request if the client is authorized, deny it otherwise. This behavior may change over time, e.g. because different clients obtain authorization over time, or because the actor may go into an “out-of-service” mode and later come back. These changes are achieved by either encoding them in state variables which are read from the behavior logic, or the function itself may be swapped out at runtime, by returning a different behavior to be used for next message. However, the initial behavior defined during construction of the actor object is special in the sense that a restart of the actor will reset its behavior to this initial one.\nMessages can be sent to an actor Reference and behind this façade there is a behavior that receives the message and acts upon it. The binding between Actor reference and behavior can change over time, but that is not visible on the outside.\nActor references are parameterized and only messages that are of the specified type can be sent to them. The association between an actor reference and its type parameter must be made when the actor reference (and its Actor) is created. For this purpose each behavior is also parameterized with the type of messages it is able to process. Since the behavior can change behind the actor reference façade, designating the next behavior is a constrained operation: the successor must handle the same type of messages as its predecessor. This is necessary in order to not invalidate the actor references that refer to this Actor.\nWhat this enables is that whenever a message is sent to an Actor we can statically ensure that the type of the message is one that the Actor declares to handle—we can avoid the mistake of sending completely pointless messages. What we cannot statically ensure, though, is that the behavior behind the actor reference will be in a given state when our message is received. The fundamental reason is that the association between actor reference and behavior is a dynamic runtime property, the compiler cannot know it while it translates the source code.\nThis is the same as for normal Java objects with internal variables: when compiling the program we cannot know what their value will be, and if the result of a method call depends on those variables then the outcome is uncertain to a degree—we can only be certain that the returned value is of a given type.\nThe reply message type of an Actor command is described by the type of the actor reference for the reply-to that is contained within the message. This allows a conversation to be described in terms of its types: the reply will be of type A, but it might also contain an address of type B, which then allows the other Actor to continue the conversation by sending a message of type B to this new actor reference. While we cannot statically express the “current” state of an Actor, we can express the current state of a protocol between two Actors, since that is just given by the last message type that was received or sent.","title":"Behavior"},{"location":"/general/actors.html#mailbox","text":"An actor’s purpose is the processing of messages, and these messages were sent to the actor from other actors (or from outside the actor system). The piece which connects sender and receiver is the actor’s mailbox: each actor has exactly one mailbox to which all senders enqueue their messages. Enqueuing happens in the time-order of send operations, which means that messages sent from different actors may not have a defined order at runtime due to the apparent randomness of distributing actors across threads. Sending multiple messages to the same target from the same actor, on the other hand, will enqueue them in the same order.\nThere are different mailbox implementations to choose from, the default being a FIFO: the order of the messages processed by the actor matches the order in which they were enqueued. This is usually a good default, but applications may need to prioritize some messages over others. In this case, a priority mailbox will enqueue not always at the end but at a position as given by the message priority, which might even be at the front. While using such a queue, the order of messages processed will naturally be defined by the queue’s algorithm and in general not be FIFO.\nAn important feature in which Pekko differs from some other actor model implementations is that the current behavior must always handle the next dequeued message, there is no scanning the mailbox for the next matching one.

If the supervisor decides that its other children or itself is not affected by the corruption—e.g. because of conscious application of the error kernel pattern—it is therefore best to restart the actor. This is carried out by creating a new instance of the underlying BehaviorBehavior class and replacing the failed instance with the fresh one inside the child’s ActorRefActorRef; the ability to do this is one of the reasons for encapsulating actors within special references.

Each actor has access to its canonical (local) reference through the ActorContext.selfActorContext.self field; this reference can be included in messages to other actors to get replies back.\nThere are several different types of actor references that are supported depending on the configuration of the actor system:\nPurely local actor references are used by actor systems which are not configured to support networking functions. These actor references will not function if sent across a network connection to a remote JVM. Local actor references when remoting is enabled are used by actor systems which support networking functions for those references which represent actors within the same JVM. In order to also be reachable when sent to other network nodes, these references include protocol and remote addressing information. Remote actor references represent actors which are reachable using remote communication, i.e. sending messages to them will serialize the messages transparently and send them to the remote JVM. There are several special types of actor references which behave like local actor references for all practical purposes: PromiseActorRef is the special representation of a Promise for the purpose of being completed by the response from an actor. org.apache.pekko.pattern.ask creates this actor reference. DeadLetterActorRef is the default implementation of the dead letters service to which Pekko routes all messages whose destinations are shut down or non-existent. EmptyLocalActorRef is what Pekko returns when looking up a non-existent local actor path: it is equivalent to a DeadLetterActorRef, but it retains its path so that Pekko can send it over the network and compare it to other existing actor references for that path, some of which might have been obtained before the actor died. And then there are some one-off internal implementations which you should never really see: There is an actor reference which does not represent an actor but acts only as a pseudo-supervisor for the root guardian, we call it “the one who walks the bubbles of space-time”.

It was possible to get all kinds of strange results when shared memory was accessed by multiple threads, such as:\na thread not seeing values written by other threads: a visibility problem a thread observing ‘impossible’ behavior of other threads, caused by instructions not being executed in the order expected: an instruction reordering problem.\nWith the implementation of JSR 133 in Java 5, a lot of these issues have been resolved. The JMM is a set of rules based on the “happens-before” relation, which constrain when one memory access must happen before another, and conversely, when they are allowed to happen out of order. Two examples of these rules are:\nThe monitor lock rule: a release of a lock happens before every subsequent acquire of the same lock. The volatile variable rule: a write of a volatile variable happens before every subsequent read of the same volatile variable\nAlthough the JMM can seem complicated, the specification tries to find a balance between ease of use and the ability to write performant and scalable concurrent data structures.","title":"The Java Memory Model"},{"location":"/general/jmm.html#actors-and-the-java-memory-model","text":"With the Actors implementation in Pekko, there are two ways multiple threads can execute actions on shared memory:\nif a message is sent to an actor (e.g. by another actor).

It is important to realize that with the actor model you don’t get any guarantee that the same thread will be executing the same actor for different messages.\nTo prevent visibility and reordering problems on actors, Pekko guarantees the following two “happens before” rules:\nThe actor send rule: the send of the message to an actor happens before the receive of that message by the same actor. The actor subsequent processing rule: processing of one message happens before processing of the next message by the same actor.\nNote In layman’s terms this means that changes to internal fields of the actor are visible when the next message is processed by that actor.

Reliability"},{"location":"/general/message-delivery-reliability.html#message-delivery-reliability","text":"Pekko helps you build reliable applications which make use of multiple processor cores in one machine (“scaling up”) or distributed across a computer network (“scaling out”). The key abstraction to make this work is that all interactions between your code units—actors—happen via message passing, which is why the precise semantics of how messages are passed between actors deserve their own chapter.\nIn order to give some context to the discussion below, consider an application which spans multiple network hosts. The basic mechanism for communication is the same whether sending to an actor on the local JVM or to a remote actor, but there will be observable differences in the latency of delivery (possibly also depending on the bandwidth of the network link and the message size) and the reliability. In case of a remote message send there are more steps involved which means that more can go wrong. Another aspect is that local sending will pass a reference to the message inside the same JVM, without any restrictions on the underlying object which is sent, whereas a remote transport will place a limit on the message size.\nWriting your actors such that every interaction could possibly be remote is the safe, pessimistic bet. It means to only rely on those properties which are always guaranteed and which are discussed in detail below. This has some overhead in the actor’s implementation. If you are willing to sacrifice full location transparency—for example in case of a group of closely collaborating actors—you can place them always on the same JVM and enjoy stricter guarantees on message delivery. The details of this trade-off are discussed further below.\nAs a supplementary part we give a few pointers at how to build stronger reliability on top of the built-in ones. The chapter closes by discussing the role of the “Dead Letter Office”.","title":"Message Delivery Reliability"},{"location":"/general/message-delivery-reliability.html#the-general-rules","text":"These are the rules for message sends (i.e. the tell or !tell method, which also underlies the ask pattern):\nat-most-once delivery, i.e. no guaranteed delivery message ordering per sender–receiver pair\nThe first rule is typically found also in other actor implementations while the second is specific to Pekko.","title":"The General Rules"},{"location":"/general/message-delivery-reliability.html#discussion-what-does-at-most-once-mean-","text":"When it comes to describing the semantics of a delivery mechanism, there are three basic categories:\nat-most-once delivery means that for each message handed to the mechanism, that message is delivered once or not at all; in more casual terms it means that messages may be lost. at-least-once delivery means that for each message handed to the mechanism potentially multiple attempts are made at delivering it, such that at least one succeeds; again, in more casual terms this means that messages may be duplicated but not lost. exactly-once delivery means that for each message handed to the mechanism exactly one delivery is made to the recipient; the message can neither be lost nor duplicated.\nThe first one is the cheapest—highest performance, least implementation overhead—because it can be done in a fire-and-forget fashion without keeping state at the sending end or in the transport mechanism. The second one requires retries to counter transport losses, which means keeping state at the sending end and having an acknowledgement mechanism at the receiving end. The third is most expensive—and has consequently worst performance—because in addition to the second it requires state to be kept at the receiving end in order to filter out duplicate deliveries.","title":"Discussion: What does “at-most-once” mean?"},{"location":"/general/message-delivery-reliability.html#discussion-why-no-guaranteed-delivery-","text":"At the core of the problem lies the question what exactly this guarantee shall mean:\nThe message is sent out on the network? The message is received by the other host? The message is put into the target actor’s mailbox? The message is starting to be processed by the target actor? The message is processed successfully by the target actor?\nEach one of these have different challenges and costs, and it is obvious that there are conditions under which any message passing library would be unable to comply; think for example about configurable mailbox types and how a bounded mailbox would interact with the third point, or even what it would mean to decide upon the “successfully” part of point five.\nAlong those same lines goes the reasoning in Nobody Needs Reliable Messaging. The only meaningful way for a sender to know whether an interaction was successful is by receiving a business-level acknowledgement message, which is not something Pekko could make up on its own (neither are we writing a “do what I mean” framework nor would you want us to).\nPekko embraces distributed computing and makes the fallibility of communication explicit through message passing, therefore it does not try to lie and emulate a leaky abstraction. This is a model that has been used with great success in Erlang and requires the users to design their applications around it. You can read more about this approach in the Erlang documentation (section 10.8 and 10.9), Pekko follows it closely.\nAnother angle on this issue is that by providing only basic guarantees those use cases which do not need stronger reliability do not pay the cost of their implementation; it is always possible to add stronger reliability on top of basic ones, but it is not possible to retro-actively remove reliability in order to gain more performance.","title":"Discussion: Why No Guaranteed Delivery?"},{"location":"/general/message-delivery-reliability.html#discussion-message-ordering","text":"The rule more specifically is that for a given pair of actors, messages sent directly from the first to the second will not be received out-of-order. The word directly emphasizes that this guarantee only applies when sending with the tell operator to the final destination, not when employing mediators or other message dissemination features (unless stated otherwise).\nThe guarantee is illustrated in the following:\nActor A1 sends messages M1, M2, M3 to A2 Actor A3 sends messages M4, M5, M6 to A2\nThis means that:\nIf M1 is delivered it must be delivered before M2 and M3 If M2 is delivered it must be delivered before M3 If M4 is delivered it must be delivered before M5 and M6 If M5 is delivered it must be delivered before M6 A2 can see messages from A1 interleaved with messages from A3 Since there is no guaranteed delivery, any of the messages may be dropped, i.e. not arrive at A2\nNote It is important to note that Pekko’s guarantee applies to the order in which messages are enqueued into the recipient’s mailbox. If the mailbox implementation does not respect FIFO order (e.g. a PriorityMailbox), then the order of processing by the actor can deviate from the enqueueing order.\nPlease note that this rule is not transitive:\nActor A sends message M1 to actor C Actor A then sends message M2 to actor B Actor B forwards message M2 to actor C Actor C may receive M1 and M2 in any order\nCausal transitive ordering would imply that M2 is never received before M1 at actor C (though any of them might be lost). This ordering can be violated due to different message delivery latencies when A, B and C reside on different network hosts, see more below.\nNote Actor creation is treated as a message sent from the parent to the child, with the same semantics as discussed above. Sending a message to an actor in a way which could be reordered with this initial creation message means that the message might not arrive because the actor does not exist yet. An example where the message might arrive too early would be to create a remote-deployed actor R1, send its reference to another remote actor R2 and have R2 send a message to R1. An example of well-defined ordering is a parent which creates an actor and immediately sends a message to it.","title":"Discussion: Message Ordering"},{"location":"/general/message-delivery-reliability.html#communication-of-failure","text":"Please note, that the ordering guarantees discussed above only hold for user messages between actors.

Since completely fair locks do not exist on the JVM this is unfixable. The same mechanism is used during the construction of a Router, more precisely the routed ActorRef, hence the same problem exists for actors deployed with Routers.

The nice thing about this scheme is that events only ever are appended to the storage, nothing is ever mutated; this enables perfect replication and scaling of consumers of this event stream (i.e. other components may consume the event stream as a means to replicate the component’s state on a different continent or to react to changes).

Greeted(message.whom, context.self)\n    Behaviors.same\n  }\n} Java copysourcepublic class HelloWorld extends AbstractBehavior<HelloWorld.Greet> {\n\n  public static final class Greet {\n    public final String whom;\n    public final ActorRef<Greeted> replyTo;\n\n    public Greet(String whom, ActorRef<Greeted> replyTo) {\n      this.whom = whom;\n      this.replyTo = replyTo;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public static final class Greeted {\n    public final String whom;\n    public final ActorRef<Greet> from;\n\n    public Greeted(String whom, ActorRef<Greet> from) {\n      this.whom = whom;\n      this.from = from;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public static Behavior<Greet> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(HelloWorld::new);\n  }\n\n  private HelloWorld(ActorContext<Greet> context) {\n    super(context);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<Greet> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder().onMessage(Greet.class, this::onGreet).build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<Greet> onGreet(Greet command) {\n    getContext().getLog().info(\"Hello {}!\", command.whom);\n    command.replyTo.tell(new Greeted(command.whom, getContext().getSelf()));\n    return this;\n  }\n}\nThis small piece of code defines two message types, one for commanding the Actor to greet someone and one that the Actor will use to confirm that it has done so. The Greet type contains not only the information of whom to greet, it also holds an ActorRefActorRef that the sender of the message supplies so that the HelloWorld Actor can send back the confirmation message.\nThe behavior of the Actor is defined as the Greeter with the help of the receivereceive behavior factory. Processing the next message then results in a new behavior that can potentially be different from this one. State is updated by returning a new behavior that holds the new immutable state. In this case we don’t need to update any state, so we return samesame, which means the next behavior is “the same as the current one”.\nThe type of the messages handled by this behavior is declared to be of class Greet., meaning that message argument is also typed as such. This is why we can access the whom and replyTo members without needing to use a pattern match. Typically, an actor handles more than one specific message type where all of them directly or indirectly extendimplement a common traitinterface.\nOn the last line we see the HelloWorld Actor send a message to another Actor, which is done using the ! operator (pronounced “bang” or “tell”)tell method. It is an asynchronous operation that doesn’t block the caller’s thread.\nSince the replyTo address is declared to be of type ActorRef[Greeted]ActorRef<Greeted>, the compiler will only permit us to send messages of this type, other usage will be a compiler error.\nThe accepted message types of an Actor together with all reply types defines the protocol spoken by this Actor; in this case it is a simple request–reply protocol but Actors can model arbitrarily complex protocols when needed. The protocol is bundled together with the behavior that implements it in a nicely wrapped scope—the HelloWorld objectclass.\nAs Carl Hewitt said, one Actor is no Actor — it would be quite lonely with nobody to talk to. We need another Actor that interacts with the Greeter. Let’s make a HelloWorldBot that receives the reply from the Greeter and sends a number of additional greeting messages and collect the replies until a given max number of messages have been reached.\nScala copysourceobject HelloWorldBot {\n\n  def apply(max: Int): Behavior[HelloWorld.Greeted] = {\n    bot(0, max)\n  }\n\n  private def bot(greetingCounter: Int, max: Int): Behavior[HelloWorld.Greeted] =\n    Behaviors.receive { (context, message) =>\n      val n = greetingCounter + 1\n      context.log.info2(\"Greeting {} for {}\", n, message.whom)\n      if (n == max) {\n        Behaviors.stopped\n      } else {\n        message.from ! HelloWorld.Greet(message.whom, context.self)\n        bot(n, max)\n      }\n    }\n} Java copysourcepublic class HelloWorldBot extends AbstractBehavior<HelloWorld.Greeted> {\n\n  public static Behavior<HelloWorld.Greeted> create(int max) {\n    return Behaviors.setup(context -> new HelloWorldBot(context, max));\n  }\n\n  private final int max;\n  private int greetingCounter;\n\n  private HelloWorldBot(ActorContext<HelloWorld.Greeted> context, int max) {\n    super(context);\n    this.max = max;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<HelloWorld.Greeted> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder().onMessage(HelloWorld.Greeted.class, this::onGreeted).build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<HelloWorld.Greeted> onGreeted(HelloWorld.Greeted message) {\n    greetingCounter++;\n    getContext().getLog().info(\"Greeting {} for {}\", greetingCounter, message.whom);\n    if (greetingCounter == max) {\n      return Behaviors.stopped();\n    } else {\n      message.from.tell(new HelloWorld.Greet(message.whom, getContext().getSelf()));\n      return this;\n    }\n  }\n}\nNote how this Actor manages the counter by changing the behavior for each Greeted reply rather than using any variables.Note how this Actor manages the counter with an instance variable. No concurrency guards such as synchronized or AtomicInteger are needed since an actor instance processes one message at a time.\nA third actor spawns the Greeter and the HelloWorldBot and starts the interaction between those.\nScala copysourceobject HelloWorldMain {\n\n  final case class SayHello(name: String)\n\n  def apply(): Behavior[SayHello] =\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      val greeter = context.spawn(HelloWorld(), \"greeter\")\n\n      Behaviors.receiveMessage { message =>\n        val replyTo = context.spawn(HelloWorldBot(max = 3), message.name)\n        greeter ! HelloWorld.Greet(message.name, replyTo)\n        Behaviors.same\n      }\n    }\n\n} Java copysourcepublic class HelloWorldMain extends AbstractBehavior<HelloWorldMain.SayHello> {\n\n  public static class SayHello {\n    public final String name;\n\n    public SayHello(String name) {\n      this.name = name;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public static Behavior<SayHello> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(HelloWorldMain::new);\n  }\n\n  private final ActorRef<HelloWorld.Greet> greeter;\n\n  private HelloWorldMain(ActorContext<SayHello> context) {\n    super(context);\n    greeter = context.spawn(HelloWorld.create(), \"greeter\");\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<SayHello> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder().onMessage(SayHello.class, this::onStart).build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<SayHello> onStart(SayHello command) {\n    ActorRef<HelloWorld.Greeted> replyTo =\n        getContext().spawn(HelloWorldBot.create(3), command.name);\n    greeter.tell(new HelloWorld.Greet(command.name, replyTo));\n    return this;\n  }\n}\nNow we want to try out this Actor, so we must start an ActorSystem to host it:\nScala copysource val system: ActorSystem[HelloWorldMain.SayHello] =\n  ActorSystem(HelloWorldMain(), \"hello\")\n\nsystem ! HelloWorldMain.SayHello(\"World\")\nsystem ! HelloWorldMain.SayHello(\"Pekko\")\n Java copysourcefinal ActorSystem<HelloWorldMain.SayHello> system =\n    ActorSystem.create(HelloWorldMain.create(), \"hello\");\n\nsystem.tell(new HelloWorldMain.SayHello(\"World\"));\nsystem.tell(new HelloWorldMain.SayHello(\"Pekko\"));\nWe start an Actor system from the defined HelloWorldMain behavior and send two SayHello messages that will kick-off the interaction between two separate HelloWorldBot actors and the single Greeter actor.\nAn application normally consists of a single ActorSystemActorSystem, running many actors, per JVM.\nThe console output may look like this:\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.814] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-4] [pekko://hello/user/greeter] Hello World!\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-4] [pekko://hello/user/greeter] Hello Pekko!\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-2] [pekko://hello/user/World] Greeting 1 for World\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-4] [pekko://hello/user/Pekko] Greeting 1 for Pekko\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-5] [pekko://hello/user/greeter] Hello World!\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-5] [pekko://hello/user/greeter] Hello Pekko!\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-4] [pekko://hello/user/World] Greeting 2 for World\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-5] [pekko://hello/user/greeter] Hello World!\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.815] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-4] [pekko://hello/user/Pekko] Greeting 2 for Pekko\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.816] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-5] [pekko://hello/user/greeter] Hello Pekko!\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.816] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-4] [pekko://hello/user/World] Greeting 3 for World\n[INFO] [03/13/2018 15:50:05.816] [hello-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher-6] [pekko://hello/user/Pekko] Greeting 3 for Pekko\nYou will also need to add a logging dependency to see that output when running.\nHere is another example that you can edit and run in the browser: import org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.LoggerOps\nimport pekko.actor.typed.{ ActorRef, ActorSystem, Behavior }\n\nobject HelloWorld {\n  final case class Greet(whom: String, replyTo: ActorRef[Greeted])\n  final case class Greeted(whom: String, from: ActorRef[Greet])\n\n  def apply(): Behavior[Greet] = Behaviors.receive { (context, message) =>\n    println(s\"Hello ${message.whom}!\")\n    message.replyTo !

Which style you choose to use is a matter of taste and both styles can be mixed depending on which is best for a specific actor. Considerations for the choice is provided in the Style Guide.\nConsider an Actor that runs a chat room: client Actors may connect by sending a message that contains their screen name and then they can post messages. The chat room Actor will disseminate all posted messages to all currently connected client Actors. The protocol definition could look like the following:\nScala copysourceobject ChatRoom {\n  sealed trait RoomCommand\n  final case class GetSession(screenName: String, replyTo: ActorRef[SessionEvent]) extends RoomCommand\n\n  sealed trait SessionEvent\n  final case class SessionGranted(handle: ActorRef[PostMessage]) extends SessionEvent\n  final case class SessionDenied(reason: String) extends SessionEvent\n  final case class MessagePosted(screenName: String, message: String) extends SessionEvent\n\n  sealed trait SessionCommand\n  final case class PostMessage(message: String) extends SessionCommand\n  private final case class NotifyClient(message: MessagePosted) extends SessionCommand\n} Java copysourcestatic interface RoomCommand {}\n\npublic static final class GetSession implements RoomCommand {\n  public final String screenName;\n  public final ActorRef<SessionEvent> replyTo;\n\n  public GetSession(String screenName, ActorRef<SessionEvent> replyTo) {\n    this.screenName = screenName;\n    this.replyTo = replyTo;\n  }\n}\n\ninterface SessionEvent {}\n\npublic static final class SessionGranted implements SessionEvent {\n  public final ActorRef<PostMessage> handle;\n\n  public SessionGranted(ActorRef<PostMessage> handle) {\n    this.handle = handle;\n  }\n}\n\npublic static final class SessionDenied implements SessionEvent {\n  public final String reason;\n\n  public SessionDenied(String reason) {\n    this.reason = reason;\n  }\n}\n\npublic static final class MessagePosted implements SessionEvent {\n  public final String screenName;\n  public final String message;\n\n  public MessagePosted(String screenName, String message) {\n    this.screenName = screenName;\n    this.message = message;\n  }\n}\n\ninterface SessionCommand {}\n\npublic static final class PostMessage implements SessionCommand {\n  public final String message;\n\n  public PostMessage(String message) {\n    this.message = message;\n  }\n}\n\nprivate static final class NotifyClient implements SessionCommand {\n  final MessagePosted message;\n\n  NotifyClient(MessagePosted message) {\n    this.message = message;\n  }\n}\nInitially the client Actors only get access to an ActorRef[GetSession]ActorRef<GetSession> which allows them to make the first step. Once a client’s session has been established it gets a SessionGranted message that contains a handle to unlock the next protocol step, posting messages. The PostMessage command will need to be sent to this particular address that represents the session that has been added to the chat room. The other aspect of a session is that the client has revealed its own address, via the replyTo argument, so that subsequent MessagePosted events can be sent to it.\nThis illustrates how Actors can express more than just the equivalent of method calls on Java objects. The declared message types and their contents describe a full protocol that can involve multiple Actors and that can evolve over multiple steps. Here’s the implementation of the chat room protocol:\nScala copysourceobject ChatRoom {\n  private final case class PublishSessionMessage(screenName: String, message: String) extends RoomCommand\n\n  def apply(): Behavior[RoomCommand] =\n    chatRoom(List.empty)\n\n  private def chatRoom(sessions: List[ActorRef[SessionCommand]]): Behavior[RoomCommand] =\n    Behaviors.receive { (context, message) =>\n      message match {\n        case GetSession(screenName, client) =>\n          // create a child actor for further interaction with the client\n          val ses = context.spawn(\n            session(context.self, screenName, client),\n            name = URLEncoder.encode(screenName, StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name))\n          client !

Then we also need to create the session’s ActorRefActorRef that will be used to post messages. In this case we want to create a very simple Actor that repackages the PostMessage command into a PublishSessionMessage command which also includes the screen name.\nThe behavior that we declare here can handle both subtypes of RoomCommand. GetSession has been explained already and the PublishSessionMessage commands coming from the session Actors will trigger the dissemination of the contained chat room message to all connected clients. But we do not want to give the ability to send PublishSessionMessage commands to arbitrary clients, we reserve that right to the internal session actors we create—otherwise clients could pose as completely different screen names (imagine the GetSession protocol to include authentication information to further secure this). Therefore PublishSessionMessage has private visibility and can’t be created outside the ChatRoom objectclass.\nIf we did not care about securing the correspondence between a session and a screen name then we could change the protocol such that PostMessage is removed and all clients just get an ActorRef[PublishSessionMessage]ActorRef<PublishSessionMessage> to send to. In this case no session actor would be needed and we could use context.selfcontext.getSelf(). The type-checks work out in that case because ActorRef[-T]ActorRef<-T>ActorRef<T>ActorRef<T> is contravariant in its type parameter, meaning that we can use a ActorRef[RoomCommand]ActorRef<RoomCommand> wherever an ActorRef[PublishSessionMessage]ActorRef<PublishSessionMessage> is needed—this makes sense because the former simply speaks more languages than the latter. The opposite would be problematic, so passing an ActorRef[PublishSessionMessage]ActorRef<PublishSessionMessage> where ActorRef[RoomCommand]ActorRef<RoomCommand> is required will lead to a type error.","title":"Functional Style"},{"location":"/typed/actors.html#trying-it-out","text":"In order to see this chat room in action we need to write a client Actor that can use it:\nScala copysourceobject Gabbler {\n  import ChatRoom._\n\n  def apply(): Behavior[SessionEvent] =\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      Behaviors.receiveMessage {\n        case SessionGranted(handle) =>\n          handle !

The last step requires the ability to change behavior, we need to transition from the normal running behavior into the terminated state. This is why here we do not return samesame, as above, but another special value stoppedstopped.\nSince SessionEvent is a sealed trait the Scala compiler will warn us if we forget to handle one of the subtypes; in this case it reminded us that alternatively to SessionGranted we may also receive a SessionDenied event.\nNow to try things out we must start both a chat room and a gabbler and of course we do this inside an Actor system. Since there can be only one user guardian we could either start the chat room from the gabbler (which we don’t want—it complicates its logic) or the gabbler from the chat room (which is nonsensical) or we start both of them from a third Actor—our only sensible choice:\nScala copysourceobject Main {\n  def apply(): Behavior[NotUsed] =\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      val chatRoom = context.spawn(ChatRoom(), \"chatroom\")\n      val gabblerRef = context.spawn(Gabbler(), \"gabbler\")\n      context.watch(gabblerRef)\n      chatRoom ! ChatRoom.GetSession(\"ol’ Gabbler\", gabblerRef)\n\n      Behaviors.receiveSignal {\n        case (_, Terminated(_)) =>\n          Behaviors.stopped\n      }\n    }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    ActorSystem(Main(), \"ChatRoomDemo\")\n  }\n\n} Java copysourcepublic class Main {\n  public static Behavior<Void> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(\n        context -> {\n          ActorRef<ChatRoom.RoomCommand> chatRoom = context.spawn(ChatRoom.create(), \"chatRoom\");\n          ActorRef<ChatRoom.SessionEvent> gabbler = context.spawn(Gabbler.create(), \"gabbler\");\n          context.watch(gabbler);\n          chatRoom.tell(new ChatRoom.GetSession(\"ol’ Gabbler\", gabbler));\n\n          return Behaviors.receive(Void.class)\n              .onSignal(Terminated.class, sig -> Behaviors.stopped())\n              .build();\n        });\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    ActorSystem.create(Main.create(), \"ChatRoomDemo\");\n  }\n}\nIn good tradition we call the Main Actor what it is, it directly corresponds to the main method in a traditional Java application. This Actor will perform its job on its own accord, we do not need to send messages from the outside, so we declare it to be of type NotUsedVoid. Actors receive not only external messages, they also are notified of certain system events, so-called Signals. In order to get access to those we choose to implement this particular one using the receivereceive behavior decorator. The provided onSignal function will be invoked for signals (subclasses of SignalSignal) or the onMessage function for user messages.\nThis particular Main Actor is created using Behaviors.setupBehaviors.setup, which is like a factory for a behavior. Creation of the behavior instance is deferred until the actor is started, as opposed to Behaviors.receiveBehaviors.receive that creates the behavior instance immediately before the actor is running. The factory function in setup is passed the ActorContextActorContext as parameter and that can for example be used for spawning child actors. This Main Actor creates the chat room and the gabbler and the session between them is initiated, and when the gabbler is finished we will receive the TerminatedTerminated event due to having called context.watchcontext.watch for it. This allows us to shut down the Actor system: when the Main Actor terminates there is nothing more to do.\nTherefore after creating the Actor system with the Main Actor’s BehaviorBehavior we can let the main method return, the ActorSystemActorSystem will continue running and the JVM alive until the root actor stops.","title":"Trying it out"},{"location":"/typed/actors.html#object-oriented-style","text":"The above sample used the functional programming style where you pass a function to a factory which then constructs a behavior, for stateful actors this means passing immutable state around as parameters and switching to a new behavior whenever you need to act on a changed state. An alternative way to express the same is a more object oriented style where a concrete class for the actor behavior is defined and mutable state is kept inside of it as fields.\nWhich style you choose to use is a matter of taste and both styles can be mixed depending on which is best for a specific actor. Considerations for the choice is provided in the Style Guide.","title":"Object-oriented style"},{"location":"/typed/actors.html#abstractbehavior-api","text":"Defining a class based actor behavior starts with extending AbstractBehaviorAbstractBehavior<T>[T] where T is the type of messages the behavior will accept.\nLet’s repeat the chat room sample from A more complex example above but implemented using AbstractBehavior.

Once a client’s session has been established it gets a SessionGranted message that contains a handle to unlock the next protocol step, posting messages. The PostMessage command will need to be sent to this particular address that represents the session that has been added to the chat room. The other aspect of a session is that the client has revealed its own address, via the replyTo argument, so that subsequent MessagePosted events can be sent to it.\nThis illustrates how Actors can express more than just the equivalent of method calls on Java objects.

As the state is mutable, we never return a different behavior from the message logic, but can return the AbstractBehavior instance itself (this) as a behavior to use for processing the next message coming in. We could also return Behaviors.sameBehaviors.same to achieve the same.\nIn this sample we make separate statements for creating the behavior builder, but it also returns the builder itself from each step so a more fluent behavior definition style is also possible. What you should prefer depends on how big the set of messages the actor accepts is.\nIt is also possible to return a new different AbstractBehavior, for example to represent a different state in a finite state machine (FSM), or use one of the functional behavior factories to combine the object oriented with the functional style for different parts of the lifecycle of the same Actor behavior.\nWhen a new GetSession command comes in we add that client to the list of current sessions. Then we also need to create the session’s ActorRefActorRef that will be used to post messages. In this case we want to create a very simple Actor that repackages the PostMessage command into a PublishSessionMessage command which also includes the screen name.\nTo implement the logic where we spawn a child for the session we need access to the ActorContextActorContext. This is injected as a constructor parameter upon creation of the behavior, note how we combine the AbstractBehaviorAbstractBehavior with Behaviors.setupBehaviors.setup to do this in the applycreate factory method.\nThe behavior that we declare here can handle both subtypes of RoomCommand.

This Actor will perform its job on its own accord, we do not need to send messages from the outside, so we declare it to be of type NotUsedVoid. Actors receive not only external messages, they also are notified of certain system events, so-called Signals. In order to get access to those we choose to implement this particular one using the receivereceive behavior decorator. The provided onSignal function will be invoked for signals (subclasses of SignalSignal) or the onMessage function for user messages.\nThis particular Main Actor is created using Behaviors.setupBehaviors.setup, which is like a factory for a behavior. Creation of the behavior instance is deferred until the actor is started, as opposed to Behaviors.receiveBehaviors.receive that creates the behavior instance immediately before the actor is running. The factory function in setup is passed the ActorContextActorContext as parameter and that can for example be used for spawning child actors. This Main Actor creates the chat room and the gabbler and the session between them is initiated, and when the gabbler is finished we will receive the TerminatedTerminated event due to having called context.watchcontext.watch for it. This allows us to shut down the Actor system: when the Main Actor terminates there is nothing more to do.\nTherefore after creating the Actor system with the Main Actor’s BehaviorBehavior we can let the main method return, the ActorSystemActorSystem will continue running and the JVM alive until the root actor stops.","title":"Try it out"},{"location":"/typed/actor-lifecycle.html","text":"","title":"Actor lifecycle"},{"location":"/typed/actor-lifecycle.html#actor-lifecycle","text":"You are viewing the documentation for the new actor APIs, to view the Pekko Classic documentation, see Classic Actors.","title":"Actor lifecycle"},{"location":"/typed/actor-lifecycle.html#dependency","text":"To use Pekko Actor Typed, you must add the following dependency in your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-actor-typed\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-actor-typed_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-actor-typed_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/typed/actor-lifecycle.html#introduction","text":"An actor is a stateful resource that has to be explicitly started and stopped.\nIt is important to note that actors do not stop automatically when no longer referenced, every Actor that is created must also explicitly be destroyed.

In particular, the watching actor will receive a terminated message even if the watched actor has already been terminated at the time of registration.\nRegistering multiple times does not necessarily lead to multiple messages being generated, but there is no guarantee that only exactly one such message is received: if termination of the watched actor has generated and queued the message, and another registration is done before this message has been processed, then a second message will be queued, because registering for monitoring of an already terminated actor leads to the immediate generation of the terminated message.\nIt is also possible to deregister from watching another actor’s liveliness using context.unwatch(target)context.unwatch(target). This works even if the terminated message has already been enqueued in the mailbox; after calling unwatch no terminated message for that actor will be processed anymore.\nThe terminated message is also sent when the watched actor is on a node that has been removed from the Cluster.","title":"Watching Actors"},{"location":"/typed/interaction-patterns.html","text":"","title":"Interaction Patterns"},{"location":"/typed/interaction-patterns.html#interaction-patterns","text":"You are viewing the documentation for the new actor APIs, to view the Pekko Classic documentation, see Classic Actors.","title":"Interaction Patterns"},{"location":"/typed/interaction-patterns.html#dependency","text":"To use Pekko Actor Typed, you must add the following dependency in your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-actor-typed\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-actor-typed_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-actor-typed_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/typed/interaction-patterns.html#introduction","text":"Interacting with an Actor in Pekko is done through an ActorRef[T]ActorRef<T> where T is the type of messages the actor accepts, also known as the “protocol”.

Having to define two response classes and a shared supertype for every request type can be repetitive, especially in a cluster context where you also have to make sure the messages can be serialized to be sent over the network.\nTo help with this a generic status-response type is included in Pekko: StatusReplyStatusReply, everywhere where ask can be used there is also a second method askWithStatusaskWithStatus which, given that the response is a StatusReply will unwrap successful responses and help with handling validation errors. Pekko includes pre-built serializers for the type, so in the normal use case a clustered application only needs to provide a serializer for the successful result.\nFor the case where the successful reply does not contain an actual value but is more of an acknowledgment there is a pre defined StatusReply.AckStatusReply.ack() of type StatusReply[Done]StatusReply<Done>.\nErrors are preferably sent as a text describing what is wrong, but using exceptions to attach a type is also possible.\nExample actor to actor ask:\nScala copysourceobject Hal {\n  sealed trait Command\n  case class OpenThePodBayDoorsPlease(replyTo: ActorRef[StatusReply[String]]) extends Command\n\n  def apply(): Behaviors.Receive[Hal.Command] =\n    Behaviors.receiveMessage[Command] {\n      case OpenThePodBayDoorsPlease(replyTo) =>\n        // reply with a validation error description\n        replyTo !

Therefore it is better to map the result to a message and perform further processing when receiving that message.\nUseful when:\nAccessing APIs that are returning FutureCompletionStage from an actor, such as a database or an external service The actor needs to continue processing when the FutureCompletionStage has completed Keep context from the original request and use that when the FutureCompletionStage has completed, for example an replyTo actor reference\nProblems:\nBoilerplate of adding wrapper messages for the results","title":"Send Future result to self"},{"location":"/typed/interaction-patterns.html#per-session-child-actor","text":"In some cases a complete response to a request can only be created and sent back after collecting multiple answers from other actors. For these kinds of interaction it can be good to delegate the work to a per “session” child actor. The child could also contain arbitrary logic to implement retrying, failing on timeout, tail chopping, progress inspection etc.\nNote that this is essentially how ask is implemented, if all you need is a single response with a timeout it is better to use ask.\nThe child is created with the context it needs to do the work, including an ActorRefActorRef that it can respond to. When the complete result is there the child responds with the result and stops itself.\nAs the protocol of the session actor is not a public API but rather an implementation detail of the parent actor, it may not always make sense to have an explicit protocol and adapt the messages of the actors that the session actor interacts with.

In this case, sending the same work request (also known as a “backup request”) to another actor results in decreased response time - because it’s less probable that multiple actors are under heavy load simultaneously. This technique is explained in depth in Jeff Dean’s presentation on Achieving Rapid Response Times in Large Online Services.\nThere are many variations of this pattern and that is the reason this is provided as a documentation example rather than a built in BehaviorBehavior in Pekko.

This can be used with any type of BehaviorBehavior, including receivereceive, receiveMessagereceiveMessage, but also setupsetup or any other behavior. Each timer has a key and if a new timer with the same key is started, the previous is cancelled. It is guaranteed that a message from the previous timer is not received, even if it was already enqueued in the mailbox when the new timer was started. Both periodic and single message timers are supported. The TimerScheduler is mutable in itself, because it performs and manages the side effects of registering the scheduled tasks. The TimerScheduler is bound to the lifecycle of the actor that owns it and is cancelled automatically when the actor is stopped. Behaviors.withTimers can also be used inside Behaviors.superviseBehaviors.supervise and it will automatically cancel the started timers correctly when the actor is restarted, so that the new incarnation will not receive scheduled messages from a previous incarnation.","title":"Scheduling messages to self"},{"location":"/typed/interaction-patterns.html#schedule-periodically","text":"Scheduling of recurring messages can have two different characteristics:\nfixed-delay - The delay between sending subsequent messages will always be (at least) the given delay. Use startTimerWithFixedDelaystartTimerWithFixedDelay. fixed-rate - The frequency of execution over time will meet the given interval. Use startTimerAtFixedRatestartTimerAtFixedRate.\nIf you are uncertain of which one to use you should pick startTimerWithFixedDelay.\nWhen using fixed-delay it will not compensate the delay between messages if the scheduling is delayed longer than specified for some reason. The delay between sending subsequent messages will always be (at least) the given delay. In the long run, the frequency of messages will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified delay.\nFixed-delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require “smoothness.” In other words, it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run.\nWhen using fixed-rate it will compensate the delay for a subsequent task if the previous messages were delayed too long. In such cases, the actual sending interval will differ from the interval passed to the scheduleAtFixedRate method.\nIf the tasks are delayed longer than the interval, the subsequent message will be sent immediately after the prior one. This also has the consequence that after long garbage collection pauses or other reasons when the JVM was suspended all “missed” tasks will execute when the process wakes up again. For example, scheduleAtFixedRate with an interval of 1 second and the process is suspended for 30 seconds will result in 30 messages being sent in rapid succession to catch up. In the long run, the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of the specified interval.\nFixed-rate execution is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to absolute time or where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important, such as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for ten seconds.\nWarning scheduleAtFixedRate can result in bursts of scheduled messages after long garbage collection pauses, which may in worst case cause undesired load on the system. scheduleWithFixedDelay is often preferred.","title":"Schedule periodically"},{"location":"/typed/interaction-patterns.html#responding-to-a-sharded-actor","text":"When Pekko Cluster is used to shard actors you need to take into account that an actor may move or get passivated.\nThe normal pattern for expecting a reply is to include an ActorRefActorRef in the message, typically a message adapter. This can be used for a sharded actor but if ctx.selfctx.getSelf() is sent and the sharded actor is moved or passivated then the reply will sent to dead letters.\nAn alternative is to send the entityId in the message and have the reply sent via sharding.\nExample:\nScala copysource// a sharded actor that needs counter updates\nobject CounterConsumer {\n  sealed trait Command\n  final case class NewCount(count: Long) extends Command\n  val TypeKey: EntityTypeKey[Command] = EntityTypeKey[Command](\"example-sharded-response\")\n}\n\n// a sharded counter that sends responses to another sharded actor\nobject Counter {\n  trait Command\n  case object Increment extends Command\n  final case class GetValue(replyToEntityId: String) extends Command\n  val TypeKey: EntityTypeKey[Command] = EntityTypeKey[Command](\"example-sharded-counter\")\n\n  private def apply(): Behavior[Command] =\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      counter(ClusterSharding(context.system), 0)\n    }\n\n  private def counter(sharding: ClusterSharding, value: Long): Behavior[Command] =\n    Behaviors.receiveMessage {\n      case Increment =>\n        counter(sharding, value + 1)\n      case GetValue(replyToEntityId) =>\n        val replyToEntityRef = sharding.entityRefFor(CounterConsumer.TypeKey, replyToEntityId)\n        replyToEntityRef !

Additionally the EntityTypeKeyEntityTypeKey could be included in the message if it is not known statically.\nAs an “alternative to the alternative”, an EntityRefEntityRef can be included in the messages. The EntityRef transparently wraps messages in a ShardingEnvelopeShardingEnvelope and sends them via sharding. If the target sharded entity has been passivated, it will be delivered to a new incarnation of that entity; if the target sharded entity has been moved to a different cluster node, it will be routed to that new node. If using this approach, be aware that at this time, a custom serializer is required.\nAs with directly including the entityId and EntityTypeKey in the message, EntityRefs do not support message adaptation: the response has to be in the protocol of the entity being responded to.\nIn some cases, it may be useful to define messages with a RecipientRefRecipientRef which is a common supertype of ActorRefActorRef and EntityRef. At this time, serializing a RecipientRef requires a custom serializer.","title":"Responding to a sharded actor"},{"location":"/typed/fault-tolerance.html","text":"","title":"Fault Tolerance"},{"location":"/typed/fault-tolerance.html#fault-tolerance","text":"You are viewing the documentation for the new actor APIs, to view the Pekko Classic documentation, see Classic Fault Tolerance.\nWhen an actor throws an unexpected exception, a failure, while processing a message or during initialization, the actor will by default be stopped.\nNote An important difference between Typed actors and Classic actors is that by default: the former are stopped if an exception is thrown and no supervision strategy is defined while in Classic they are restarted.\nNote that there is an important distinction between failures and validation errors:\nA validation error means that the data of a command sent to an actor is not valid, this should rather be modelled as a part of the actor protocol than make the actor throw exceptions.\nA failure is instead something unexpected or outside the control of the actor itself, for example a database connection that broke. Opposite to validation errors, it is seldom useful to model failures as part of the protocol as a sending actor can very seldomly do anything useful about it.\nFor failures it is useful to apply the “let it crash” philosophy: instead of mixing fine grained recovery and correction of internal state that may have become partially invalid because of the failure with the business logic we move that responsibility somewhere else. For many cases the resolution can then be to “crash” the actor, and start a new one, with a fresh state that we know is valid.","title":"Fault Tolerance"},{"location":"/typed/fault-tolerance.html#supervision","text":"In Pekko, this “somewhere else” is called supervision. Supervision allows you to declaratively describe what should happen when certain types of exceptions are thrown inside an actor.\nThe default supervision strategy is to stop the actor if an exception is thrown. In many cases you will want to further customize this behavior. To use supervision the actual Actor behavior is wrapped using Behaviors.superviseBehaviors.supervise. Typically you would wrap the actor with supervision in the parent when spawning it as a child.\nThis example restarts the actor when it fails with an IllegalStateException:\nScala copysourceBehaviors.supervise(behavior).onFailure[IllegalStateException](SupervisorStrategy.restart) Java copysourceBehaviors.supervise(behavior)\n    .onFailure(IllegalStateException.class, SupervisorStrategy.restart());\nOr to resume, ignore the failure and process the next message, instead:\nScala copysourceBehaviors.supervise(behavior).onFailure[IllegalStateException](SupervisorStrategy.resume) Java copysourceBehaviors.supervise(behavior)\n    .onFailure(IllegalStateException.class, SupervisorStrategy.resume());\nMore complicated restart strategies can be used e.g. to restart no more than 10 times in a 10 second period:\nScala copysourceBehaviors\n  .supervise(behavior)\n  .onFailure[IllegalStateException](\n    SupervisorStrategy.restart.withLimit(maxNrOfRetries = 10, withinTimeRange = 10.seconds)) Java copysourceBehaviors.supervise(behavior)\n    .onFailure(\n        IllegalStateException.class,\n        SupervisorStrategy.restart().withLimit(10, Duration.ofSeconds(10)));\nTo handle different exceptions with different strategies calls to supervisesupervise can be nested:\nScala copysourceBehaviors\n  .supervise(Behaviors.supervise(behavior).onFailure[IllegalStateException](SupervisorStrategy.restart))\n  .onFailure[IllegalArgumentException](SupervisorStrategy.stop) Java copysourceBehaviors.supervise(\n        Behaviors.supervise(behavior)\n            .onFailure(IllegalStateException.class, SupervisorStrategy.restart()))\n    .onFailure(IllegalArgumentException.class, SupervisorStrategy.stop());\nFor a full list of strategies see the public methods on SupervisorStrategySupervisorStrategy.\nNote When the behavior is restarted the original BehaviorBehavior that was given to Behaviors.superviseBehaviors.supervise is re-installed, which means that if it contains mutable state it must be a factory via Behaviors.setupBehaviors.setup. When using the object-oriented style with a class extending AbstractBehaviorAbstractBehavior it’s always recommended to create it via Behaviors.setupBehaviors.setup as described in Behavior factory method.

obtain Actor references: by creating actors and by discovery using the Receptionist.\nYou can pass actor references between actors as constructor parameters or part of messages.\nSometimes, you need something to bootstrap the interaction, for example when actors are running on different nodes in the Cluster or when “dependency injection” with constructor parameters is not applicable.","title":"Obtaining Actor references"},{"location":"/typed/actor-discovery.html#receptionist","text":"When an actor needs to be discovered by another actor but you are unable to put a reference to it in an incoming message, you can use the ReceptionistReceptionist. It supports both local and cluster(see cluster). You register the specific actors that should be discoverable from each node in the local Receptionist instance. The API of the receptionist is also based on actor messages. This registry of actor references is then automatically distributed to all other nodes in the case of a cluster. You can lookup such actors with the key that was used when they were registered. The reply to such a Find request is a Listing, which contains a Set of actor references that are registered for the key. Note that several actors can be registered to the same key.\nThe registry is dynamic. New actors can be registered during the lifecycle of the system. Entries are removed when registered actors are stopped, manually deregistered or the node they live on is removed from the Cluster. To facilitate this dynamic aspect you can also subscribe to changes with the Receptionist.Subscribe message. It will send Listing messages to the subscriber, first with the set of entries upon subscription, then whenever the entries for a key are changed.\nThese imports are used in the following example:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.typed.ActorRef\nimport pekko.actor.typed.Behavior\nimport pekko.actor.typed.receptionist.Receptionist\nimport pekko.actor.typed.receptionist.ServiceKey\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors Java copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.ActorRef;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.Behavior;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.javadsl.ActorContext;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.javadsl.Behaviors;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.receptionist.Receptionist;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.receptionist.ServiceKey;\nFirst we create a PingService actor and register it with the Receptionist against a ServiceKeyServiceKey that will later be used to lookup the reference:\nScala copysourceobject PingService {\n  val PingServiceKey = ServiceKey[Ping](\"pingService\")\n\n  final case class Ping(replyTo: ActorRef[Pong.type])\n  case object Pong\n\n  def apply(): Behavior[Ping] = {\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      context.system.receptionist !

PingService.Ping(context.self)\n\n      Behaviors.receiveMessage { _ =>\n        context.log.info(\"{} was ponged!!\", context.self)\n        Behaviors.stopped\n      }\n    }\n  }\n} Java copysourcepublic class Pinger {\n  private final ActorContext<PingService.Pong> context;\n  private final ActorRef<PingService.Ping> pingService;\n\n  private Pinger(ActorContext<PingService.Pong> context, ActorRef<PingService.Ping> pingService) {\n    this.context = context;\n    this.pingService = pingService;\n  }\n\n  public static Behavior<PingService.Pong> create(ActorRef<PingService.Ping> pingService) {\n    return Behaviors.setup(\n        ctx -> {\n          pingService.tell(new PingService.Ping(ctx.getSelf()));\n          return new Pinger(ctx, pingService).behavior();\n        });\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<PingService.Pong> behavior() {\n    return Behaviors.receive(PingService.Pong.class)\n        .onMessage(PingService.Pong.class, this::onPong)\n        .build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<PingService.Pong> onPong(PingService.Pong msg) {\n    context.getLog().info(\"{} was ponged!!\", context.getSelf());\n    return Behaviors.stopped();\n  }\n}\nFinally in the guardian actor we spawn the service as well as subscribing to any actors registering against the ServiceKeyServiceKey. Subscribing means that the guardian actor will be informed of any new registrations via a Listing message:\nScala copysourceobject Guardian {\n  def apply(): Behavior[Nothing] = {\n    Behaviors\n      .setup[Receptionist.Listing] { context =>\n        context.spawnAnonymous(PingService())\n        context.system.receptionist !

The Pinger sends a Ping message and when receiving the Pong reply it stops.\nIn above example we used Receptionist.Subscribe, but it’s also possible to request a single Listing of the current state without receiving further updates by sending the Receptionist.Find message to the receptionist. An example of using Receptionist.Find:\nScala copysourceobject PingManager {\n  sealed trait Command\n  case object PingAll extends Command\n  private case class ListingResponse(listing: Receptionist.Listing) extends Command\n\n  def apply(): Behavior[Command] = {\n    Behaviors.setup[Command] { context =>\n      val listingResponseAdapter = context.messageAdapter[Receptionist.Listing](ListingResponse.apply)\n\n      context.spawnAnonymous(PingService())\n\n      Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial {\n        case PingAll =>\n          context.system.receptionist !

The acknowledgement does not guarantee that all subscribers has seen that the instance has been removed, it may still receive messages from subscribers for some time after this.\nScala copysourcecontext.system.receptionist !

The DataAccess actor below is used like a single access point to a value stored in a database.

It’s recommended to avoid stashing too many messages to avoid too much memory usage and even risking OutOfMemoryError if many actors are stashing many messages. Therefore the StashBufferStashBuffer is bounded and the capacity of how many messages it can hold must be specified when it’s created.\nIf you try to stash more messages than the capacity a StashOverflowExceptionStashOverflowException will be thrown. You can use StashBuffer.isFullStashBuffer.isFull before stashing a message to avoid that and take other actions, such as dropping the message.\nWhen unstashing the buffered messages by calling unstashAllunstashAll the messages will be processed sequentially in the order they were added and all are processed unless an exception is thrown. The actor is unresponsive to other new messages until unstashAllunstashAll is completed. That is another reason for keeping the number of stashed messages low. Actors that hog the message processing thread for too long can result in starvation of other actors.\nThat can be mitigated by using the StashBuffer.unstashStashBuffer.unstash with numberOfMessages parameter and then send a message to context.selfcontext.getSelf before continuing unstashing more. That means that other new messages may arrive in-between and those must be stashed to keep the original order of messages. It becomes more complicated, so better keep the number of stashed messages low.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/typed/fsm.html","text":"","title":"Behaviors as finite state machines"},{"location":"/typed/fsm.html#behaviors-as-finite-state-machines","text":"You are viewing the documentation for the new actor APIs, to view the Pekko Classic documentation, see Classic FSM.\nAn actor can be used to model a Finite State Machine (FSM).\nTo demonstrate this, consider an actor which shall receive and queue messages while they arrive in a burst and send them on after the burst ended or a flush request is received.\nThis example demonstrates how to:\nModel states using different behaviors Model storing data at each state by representing the behavior as a method Implement state timeouts\nThe events the FSM can receive become the type of message the Actor can receive:\nScala copysourceobject Buncher {\n\n  // FSM event becomes the type of the message Actor supports\n  sealed trait Event\n  final case class SetTarget(ref: ActorRef[Batch]) extends Event\n  final case class Queue(obj: Any) extends Event\n  case object Flush extends Event\n  private case object Timeout extends Event\n} Java copysourcepublic abstract class Buncher {\n\n  public interface Event {}\n\n  public static final class SetTarget implements Event {\n    public final ActorRef<Batch> ref;\n\n    public SetTarget(ActorRef<Batch> ref) {\n      this.ref = ref;\n    }\n  }\n\n  private enum Timeout implements Event {\n    INSTANCE\n  }\n\n  public enum Flush implements Event {\n    INSTANCE\n  }\n\n  public static final class Queue implements Event {\n    public final Object obj;\n\n    public Queue(Object obj) {\n      this.obj = obj;\n    }\n  }\n}\nSetTarget is needed for starting it up, setting the destination for the Batches to be passed on; Queue will add to the internal queue while Flush will mark the end of a burst.\nScala copysourcesealed trait Data\ncase object Uninitialized extends Data\nfinal case class Todo(target: ActorRef[Batch], queue: immutable.Seq[Any]) extends Data\n\nfinal case class Batch(obj: immutable.Seq[Any]) Java copysourceinterface Data {}\n\npublic static final class Todo implements Data {\n  public final ActorRef<Batch> target;\n  public final List<Object> queue;\n\n  public Todo(ActorRef<Batch> target, List<Object> queue) {\n    this.target = target;\n    this.queue = queue;\n  }\n\n}\n\npublic static final class Batch {\n  public final List<Object> list;\n\n  public Batch(List<Object> list) {\n    this.list = list;\n  }\n\n}\nEach state becomes a distinct behavior and after processing a message the next state in the form of a Behavior is returned.\nScala copysourceobject Buncher {\n  // states of the FSM represented as behaviors\n\n  // initial state\n  def apply(): Behavior[Event] = idle(Uninitialized)\n\n  private def idle(data: Data): Behavior[Event] = Behaviors.receiveMessage[Event] { message =>\n    (message, data) match {\n      case (SetTarget(ref), Uninitialized) =>\n        idle(Todo(ref, Vector.empty))\n      case (Queue(obj), t @ Todo(_, v)) =>\n        active(t.copy(queue = v :+ obj))\n      case _ =>\n        Behaviors.unhandled\n    }\n  }\n\n  private def active(data: Todo): Behavior[Event] =\n    Behaviors.withTimers[Event] { timers =>\n      // instead of FSM state timeout\n      timers.startSingleTimer(Timeout, 1.second)\n      Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial {\n        case Flush | Timeout =>\n          data.target !

The phases are ordered with topological sort of the DAG.\nTasks can be added to a phase like in this example which allows a certain actor to react before termination starts:\nScala copysourceobject MyActor {\n\n  trait Messages\n  case class Stop(replyTo: ActorRef[Done]) extends Messages\n\n  def behavior: Behavior[Messages] =\n    Behaviors.receiveMessage {\n      // ...\n      case Stop(replyTo) =>\n        // shut down the actor internals\n        // ..\n        replyTo.tell(Done)\n        Behaviors.stopped\n    }\n}\n\n  CoordinatedShutdown(context.system).addTask(CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseBeforeServiceUnbind, \"someTaskName\") { () =>\n    implicit val timeout: Timeout = 5.seconds\n    myActor.ask(MyActor.Stop(_))\n  } Java copysourceimport static org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.javadsl.AskPattern.ask;\n\npublic static class MyActor extends AbstractBehavior<MyActor.Messages> {\n  interface Messages {}\n\n  // ...\n\n  static final class Stop implements Messages {\n    final ActorRef<Done> replyTo;\n\n    Stop(ActorRef<Done> replyTo) {\n      this.replyTo = replyTo;\n    }\n  }\n  @Override\n  public Receive<Messages> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder().onMessage(Stop.class, this::stop).build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<Messages> stop(Stop stop) {\n    // shut down the actor internal\n    // ...\n    stop.replyTo.tell(Done.done());\n    return Behaviors.stopped();\n  }\n}\n\n          CoordinatedShutdown.get(system)\n              .addTask(\n                  CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseBeforeServiceUnbind(),\n                  \"someTaskName\",\n                  () ->\n                      ask(myActor, MyActor.Stop::new, Duration.ofSeconds(5), system.scheduler()));\nThe returned Future[Done] CompletionStage<Done> should be completed when the task is completed. The task name parameter is only used for debugging/logging.\nTasks added to the same phase are executed in parallel without any ordering assumptions. Next phase will not start until all tasks of previous phase have been completed.\nIf tasks are not completed within a configured timeout (see reference.conf) the next phase will be started anyway. It is possible to configure recover=off for a phase to abort the rest of the shutdown process if a task fails or is not completed within the timeout.\nIf cancellation of previously added tasks is required:\nScala copysourceval c: Cancellable =\n  CoordinatedShutdown(system).addCancellableTask(CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseBeforeServiceUnbind, \"cleanup\") { () =>\n    Future {\n      cleanup()\n      Done\n    }\n  }\n\n// much later...\nc.cancel() Java copysourceCancellable cancellable =\n    CoordinatedShutdown.get(system)\n        .addCancellableTask(\n            CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseBeforeServiceUnbind(), \"someTaskCleanup\", () -> cleanup());\n// much later...\ncancellable.cancel();\nIn the above example, it may be more convenient to simply stop the actor when it’s done shutting down, rather than send back a done message, and for the shutdown task to not complete until the actor is terminated. A convenience method is provided that adds a task that sends a message to the actor and then watches its termination (there is currently no corresponding functionality for the new actors API see #29056):\nScala copysourceCoordinatedShutdown(system).addActorTerminationTask(\n  CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseBeforeServiceUnbind,\n  \"someTaskName\",\n  someActor,\n  Some(\"stop\")) Java copysourceCoordinatedShutdown.get(system)\n    .addActorTerminationTask(\n        CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseBeforeServiceUnbind(),\n        \"someTaskName\",\n        someActor,\n        Optional.of(\"stop\"));\nTasks should typically be registered as early as possible after system startup. When running the coordinated shutdown tasks that have been registered will be performed but tasks that are added too late will not be run.\nTo start the coordinated shutdown process you can either invoke terminate() on the ActorSystem, or run runAll on the CoordinatedShutdown extension and pass it a class implementing CoordinatedShutdown.ReasonCoordinatedShutdown.Reason for informational purposes:\nScala copysource// shut down with `ActorSystemTerminateReason`\nsystem.terminate()\n\n// or define a specific reason\ncase object UserInitiatedShutdown extends CoordinatedShutdown.Reason\n\nval done: Future[Done] = CoordinatedShutdown(system).run(UserInitiatedShutdown) Java copysource// shut down with `ActorSystemTerminateReason`\nsystem.terminate();\n\n// or define a specific reason\nclass UserInitiatedShutdown implements CoordinatedShutdown.Reason {\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n    return \"UserInitiatedShutdown\";\n  }\n}\n\nCompletionStage<Done> done =\n    CoordinatedShutdown.get(system).runAll(new UserInitiatedShutdown());\nIt’s safe to call the run runAll method multiple times. It will only run once.\nThat also means that the ActorSystem will be terminated in the last phase. By default, the JVM is not forcefully stopped (it will be stopped if all non-daemon threads have been terminated). To enable a hard System.exit as a final action you can configure:\npekko.coordinated-shutdown.exit-jvm = on\nThe coordinated shutdown process is also started once the actor system’s root actor is stopped.\nWhen using Pekko Cluster the CoordinatedShutdown will automatically run when the cluster node sees itself as Exiting, i.e. leaving from another node will trigger the shutdown process on the leaving node. Tasks for graceful leaving of cluster including graceful shutdown of Cluster Singletons and Cluster Sharding are added automatically when Pekko Cluster is used, i.e. running the shutdown process will also trigger the graceful leaving if it’s not already in progress.\nBy default, the CoordinatedShutdown will be run when the JVM process exits, e.g. via kill SIGTERM signal (SIGINT ctrl-c doesn’t work). This behavior can be disabled with:\npekko.coordinated-shutdown.run-by-jvm-shutdown-hook=off\nIf you have application specific JVM shutdown hooks it’s recommended that you register them via the CoordinatedShutdown so that they are running before Pekko internal shutdown hooks, e.g. those shutting down Pekko Remoting (Artery).\nScala copysourceCoordinatedShutdown(system).addJvmShutdownHook {\n  println(\"custom JVM shutdown hook...\")\n} Java copysourceCoordinatedShutdown.get(system)\n    .addJvmShutdownHook(() -> System.out.println(\"custom JVM shutdown hook...\"));\nFor some tests it might be undesired to terminate the ActorSystem via CoordinatedShutdown. You can disable that by adding the following to the configuration of the ActorSystem that is used in the test:\n# Don't terminate ActorSystem via CoordinatedShutdown in tests\npekko.coordinated-shutdown.terminate-actor-system = off\npekko.coordinated-shutdown.run-by-actor-system-terminate = off\npekko.coordinated-shutdown.run-by-jvm-shutdown-hook = off\npekko.cluster.run-coordinated-shutdown-when-down = off","title":"Coordinated Shutdown"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html","text":"","title":"Dispatchers"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#dispatchers","text":"You are viewing the documentation for the new actor APIs, to view the Pekko Classic documentation, see Classic Dispatchers.","title":"Dispatchers"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#dependency","text":"Dispatchers are part of core Pekko, which means that they are part of the pekko-actor dependency.

The same principle applies with Pekko actors.","title":"Blocking Needs Careful Management"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#problem-blocking-on-default-dispatcher","text":"Simply adding blocking calls to your actor message processing like this is problematic:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.typed.Behavior\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors\n\nobject BlockingActor {\n  def apply(): Behavior[Int] =\n    Behaviors.receiveMessage { i =>\n      // DO NOT DO THIS HERE: this is an example of incorrect code,\n      // better alternatives are described further on.\n\n      // block for 5 seconds, representing blocking I/O, etc\n      Thread.sleep(5000)\n      println(s\"Blocking operation finished: $i\")\n      Behaviors.same\n    }\n} Java copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.*;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.javadsl.*;\n\npublic class BlockingActor extends AbstractBehavior<Integer> {\n  public static Behavior<Integer> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(BlockingActor::new);\n  }\n\n  private BlockingActor(ActorContext<Integer> context) {\n    super(context);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<Integer> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder()\n        .onMessage(\n            Integer.class,\n            i -> {\n              // DO NOT DO THIS HERE: this is an example of incorrect code,\n              // better alternatives are described further on.\n\n              // block for 5 seconds, representing blocking I/O, etc\n              Thread.sleep(5000);\n              System.out.println(\"Blocking operation finished: \" + i);\n              return Behaviors.same();\n            })\n        .build();\n  }\n}\nWithout any further configuration the default dispatcher runs this actor along with all other actors. This is very efficient when all actor message processing is non-blocking. When all of the available threads are blocked, however, then all the actors on the same dispatcher will starve for threads and will not be able to process incoming messages.\nNote Blocking APIs should also be avoided if possible. Try to find or build Reactive APIs, such that blocking is minimised, or moved over to dedicated dispatchers. Often when integrating with existing libraries or systems it is not possible to avoid blocking APIs. The following solution explains how to handle blocking operations properly. Note that the same hints apply to managing blocking operations anywhere in Pekko, including Streams, HTTP and other reactive libraries built on top of it.\nTo demonstrate this problem, let’s set up an application with the above BlockingActor and the following PrintActor:\nScala copysourceobject PrintActor {\n  def apply(): Behavior[Integer] =\n    Behaviors.receiveMessage { i =>\n      println(s\"PrintActor: $i\")\n      Behaviors.same\n    }\n} Java copysourceclass PrintActor extends AbstractBehavior<Integer> {\n\n  public static Behavior<Integer> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(PrintActor::new);\n  }\n\n  private PrintActor(ActorContext<Integer> context) {\n    super(context);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<Integer> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder()\n        .onMessage(\n            Integer.class,\n            i -> {\n              System.out.println(\"PrintActor: \" + i);\n              return Behaviors.same();\n            })\n        .build();\n  }\n}\nScala copysourceval root = Behaviors.setup[Nothing] { context =>\n  for (i <- 1 to 100) {\n    context.spawn(BlockingFutureActor(), s\"futureActor-$i\") ! i\n    context.spawn(PrintActor(), s\"printActor-$i\") ! i\n  }\n  Behaviors.empty\n}\nval system = ActorSystem[Nothing](root, \"BlockingDispatcherSample\") Java copysourceBehavior<Void> root =\n    Behaviors.setup(\n        context -> {\n          for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n            context.spawn(BlockingActor.create(), \"BlockingActor-\" + i).tell(i);\n            context.spawn(PrintActor.create(), \"PrintActor-\" + i).tell(i);\n          }\n          return Behaviors.ignore();\n        });\nHere the app is sending 100 messages to BlockingActors and PrintActors and large numbers of pekko.actor.default-dispatcher threads are handling requests. When you run the above code, you will likely to see the entire application gets stuck somewhere like this:\n>　PrintActor: 44\n>　PrintActor: 45\nPrintActor is considered non-blocking, however it is not able to proceed with handling the remaining messages, since all the threads are occupied and blocked by the other blocking actors - thus leading to thread starvation.\nIn the thread state diagrams below the colours have the following meaning:\nTurquoise - Sleeping state Orange - Waiting state Green - Runnable state\nThe thread information was recorded using the YourKit profiler, however any good JVM profiler has this feature (including the free and bundled with the Oracle JDK VisualVM, as well as Java Mission Control).\nThe orange portion of the thread shows that it is idle. Idle threads are fine - they’re ready to accept new work. However, a large number of turquoise (blocked, or sleeping as in our example) threads leads to thread starvation.\nIn the above example we put the code under load by sending hundreds of messages to blocking actors which causes threads of the default dispatcher to be blocked. The fork join pool based dispatcher in Pekko then attempts to compensate for this blocking by adding more threads to the pool (default-pekko.actor.default-dispatcher 18,19,20,...). This however is not able to help if those too will immediately get blocked, and eventually the blocking operations will dominate the entire dispatcher.\nIn essence, the Thread.sleep operation has dominated all threads and caused anything executing on the default dispatcher to starve for resources (including any actor that you have not configured an explicit dispatcher for).\nNon-solution: Wrapping in a Future When facing this, you may be tempted to wrap the blocking call inside a Future and work with that instead, but this strategy is too simplistic: you are quite likely to find bottlenecks or run out of memory or threads when the application runs under increased load. Scala copysourceobject BlockingFutureActor {\n  def apply(): Behavior[Int] =\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContext = context.executionContext\n\n      Behaviors.receiveMessage { i =>\n        triggerFutureBlockingOperation(i)\n        Behaviors.same\n      }\n    }\n\n  def triggerFutureBlockingOperation(i: Int)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Unit] = {\n    println(s\"Calling blocking Future: $i\")\n    Future {\n      Thread.sleep(5000) // block for 5 seconds\n      println(s\"Blocking future finished $i\")\n    }\n  }\n} The key problematic line here is this: implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContext = context.executionContext\n Using context.executionContext as the dispatcher on which the blocking Future executes can still be a problem, since this dispatcher is by default used for all other actor processing unless you set up a separate dispatcher for the actor.","title":"Problem: Blocking on default dispatcher"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#solution-dedicated-dispatcher-for-blocking-operations","text":"An efficient method of isolating the blocking behavior, such that it does not impact the rest of the system, is to prepare and use a dedicated dispatcher for all those blocking operations. This technique is often referred to as “bulk-heading” or simply “isolating blocking”.\nIn application.conf, the dispatcher dedicated to blocking behavior should be configured as follows:\ncopysourcemy-blocking-dispatcher {\n  type = Dispatcher\n  executor = \"thread-pool-executor\"\n  thread-pool-executor {\n    fixed-pool-size = 16\n  }\n  throughput = 1\n}\nA thread-pool-executor based dispatcher allows us to limit the number of threads it will host, and this way we gain tight control over the maximum number of blocked threads the system may use.\nThe exact size should be fine tuned depending on the workload you’re expecting to run on this dispatcher.\nWhenever blocking has to be done, use the above configured dispatcher instead of the default one:\nScala copysourceobject SeparateDispatcherFutureActor {\n  def apply(): Behavior[Int] =\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContext =\n        context.system.dispatchers.lookup(DispatcherSelector.fromConfig(\"my-blocking-dispatcher\"))\n\n      Behaviors.receiveMessage { i =>\n        triggerFutureBlockingOperation(i)\n        Behaviors.same\n      }\n    }\n\n  def triggerFutureBlockingOperation(i: Int)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Unit] = {\n    println(s\"Calling blocking Future: $i\")\n    Future {\n      Thread.sleep(5000) // block for 5 seconds\n      println(s\"Blocking future finished $i\")\n    }\n  }\n} Java copysourceclass SeparateDispatcherFutureActor extends AbstractBehavior<Integer> {\n  private final Executor ec;\n\n  public static Behavior<Integer> create() {\n    return Behaviors.setup(SeparateDispatcherFutureActor::new);\n  }\n\n  private SeparateDispatcherFutureActor(ActorContext<Integer> context) {\n    super(context);\n    ec =\n        context\n            .getSystem()\n            .dispatchers()\n            .lookup(DispatcherSelector.fromConfig(\"my-blocking-dispatcher\"));\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<Integer> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder()\n        .onMessage(\n            Integer.class,\n            i -> {\n              triggerFutureBlockingOperation(i, ec);\n              return Behaviors.same();\n            })\n        .build();\n  }\n\n  private static void triggerFutureBlockingOperation(Integer i, Executor ec) {\n    System.out.println(\"Calling blocking Future on separate dispatcher: \" + i);\n    CompletableFuture<Integer> f =\n        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(\n            () -> {\n              try {\n                Thread.sleep(5000);\n                System.out.println(\"Blocking future finished: \" + i);\n                return i;\n              } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                return -1;\n              }\n            },\n            ec);\n  }\n}\nThe thread pool behavior is shown in the below diagram.\nMessages sent to SeparateDispatcherFutureActorSeparateDispatcherCompletionStageActor and PrintActor are handled by the default dispatcher - the green lines, which represent the actual execution.\nWhen blocking operations are run on the my-blocking-dispatcher, it uses the threads (up to the configured limit) to handle these operations. The sleeping in this case is nicely isolated to just this dispatcher, and the default one remains unaffected, allowing the rest of the application to proceed as if nothing bad was happening. After a certain period of idleness, threads started by this dispatcher will be shut down.\nIn this case, the throughput of other actors was not impacted - they were still served on the default dispatcher.\nThis is the recommended way of dealing with any kind of blocking in reactive applications.\nFor a similar discussion specifically about Pekko HTTP, refer to Handling blocking operations in Pekko HTTP.","title":"Solution: Dedicated dispatcher for blocking operations"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#available-solutions-to-blocking-operations","text":"The non-exhaustive list of adequate solutions to the “blocking problem” includes the following suggestions:\nDo the blocking call within a FutureCompletionStage, ensuring an upper bound on the number of such calls at any point in time (submitting an unbounded number of tasks of this nature will exhaust your memory or thread limits). Do the blocking call within a Future, providing a thread pool with an upper limit on the number of threads which is appropriate for the hardware on which the application runs, as explained in detail in this section. Dedicate a single thread to manage a set of blocking resources (e.g. a NIO selector driving multiple channels) and dispatch events as they occur as actor messages. Do the blocking call within an actor (or a set of actors) managed by a router, making sure to configure a thread pool which is either dedicated for this purpose or sufficiently sized.\nThe last possibility is especially well-suited for resources which are single-threaded in nature, like database handles which traditionally can only execute one outstanding query at a time and use internal synchronization to ensure this. A common pattern is to create a router for N actors, each of which wraps a single DB connection and handles queries as sent to the router. The number N must then be tuned for maximum throughput, which will vary depending on which DBMS is deployed on what hardware.\nNote Configuring thread pools is a task best delegated to Pekko, configure it in application.conf and instantiate through an ActorSystem","title":"Available solutions to blocking operations"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#more-dispatcher-configuration-examples","text":"","title":"More dispatcher configuration examples"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#fixed-pool-size","text":"Configuring a dispatcher with fixed thread pool size, e.g. for actors that perform blocking IO:\ncopysourceblocking-io-dispatcher {\n  type = Dispatcher\n  executor = \"thread-pool-executor\"\n  thread-pool-executor {\n    fixed-pool-size = 32\n  }\n  throughput = 1\n}","title":"Fixed pool size"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#cores","text":"Another example that uses the thread pool based on the number of cores (e.g. for CPU bound tasks)\ncopysourcemy-thread-pool-dispatcher {\n  # Dispatcher is the name of the event-based dispatcher\n  type = Dispatcher\n  # What kind of ExecutionService to use\n  executor = \"thread-pool-executor\"\n  # Configuration for the thread pool\n  thread-pool-executor {\n    # minimum number of threads to cap factor-based core number to\n    core-pool-size-min = 2\n    # No of core threads ... ceil(available processors * factor)\n    core-pool-size-factor = 2.0\n    # maximum number of threads to cap factor-based number to\n    core-pool-size-max = 10\n  }\n  # Throughput defines the maximum number of messages to be\n  # processed per actor before the thread jumps to the next actor.\n  # Set to 1 for as fair as possible.\n  throughput = 100\n}","title":"Cores"},{"location":"/typed/dispatchers.html#pinned","text":"A separate thread is dedicated for each actor that is configured to use the pinned dispatcher.\nConfiguring a PinnedDispatcher:\ncopysourcemy-pinned-dispatcher {\n  executor = \"thread-pool-executor\"\n  type = PinnedDispatcher\n}\nNote that thread-pool-executor configuration as per the above my-thread-pool-dispatcher example is NOT applicable.

Instead, you might want to create mock behaviors that accept and possibly respond to messages in the same way the other actor would do but without executing any actual logic. In addition to this it can also be useful to observe those interactions to assert that the component under test did send the expected messages. This allows the same kinds of tests as classic TestActor/Autopilot.\nAs an example, let’s assume we’d like to test the following component:\nScala copysourcecase class Message(i: Int, replyTo: ActorRef[Try[Int]])\n\nclass Producer(publisher: ActorRef[Message])(implicit scheduler: Scheduler) {\n\n  def produce(messages: Int)(implicit timeout: Timeout): Unit = {\n    (0 until messages).foreach(publish)\n  }\n\n  private def publish(i: Int)(implicit timeout: Timeout): Future[Try[Int]] = {\n    publisher.ask(ref => Message(i, ref))\n  }\n\n} Java copysource static class Message {\n  int i;\n  ActorRef<Integer> replyTo;\n\n  Message(int i, ActorRef<Integer> replyTo) {\n    this.i = i;\n    this.replyTo = replyTo;\n  }\n}\n\npublic static class Producer {\n\n  private Scheduler scheduler;\n  private ActorRef<Message> publisher;\n\n  Producer(Scheduler scheduler, ActorRef<Message> publisher) {\n    this.scheduler = scheduler;\n    this.publisher = publisher;\n  }\n\n  public void produce(int messages) {\n    IntStream.range(0, messages).forEach(this::publish);\n  }\n\n  private CompletionStage<Integer> publish(int i) {\n    return AskPattern.ask(\n        publisher,\n        (ActorRef<Integer> ref) -> new Message(i, ref),\n        Duration.ofSeconds(3),\n        scheduler);\n  }\n}\nIn our test, we create a mocked publisher actor.

Both have an apply factory method in the companion objecta static create factory method to create the initial behavior, i.e. from the outside they are used in the same way. Pattern matchingMatching and handling of the messages are done in the same way. The ActorContext API is the same.\nA few differences to note:\nThere is no class in the functional style, but that is not strictly a requirement and sometimes it’s convenient to use a class also with the functional style to reduce number of parameters in the methods. Mutable state, such as the var nint n is typically used in the object-oriented style. In the functional style the state is is updated by returning a new behavior that holds the new immutable state, the n: Intfinal int n parameter of the counter method. The object-oriented style must use a new instance of the initial Behavior for each spawned actor instance, since the state in AbstractBehavior instance must not be shared between actor instances. This is “hidden” in the functional style since the immutable state is captured by the function. In the object-oriented style one can return this to stay with the same behavior for next message. In the functional style there is no this so Behaviors.same is used instead. The ActorContext is accessed in different ways. In the object-oriented style it’s retrieved from Behaviors.setup and kept as an instance field, while in the functional style it’s passed in alongside the message. That said, Behaviors.setup is often used in the functional style as well, and then often together with Behaviors.receiveMessage that doesn’t pass in the context with the message. The ActorContext is accessed with Behaviors.setup but then kept in different ways. As an instance field versus a method parameter.\nWhich style you choose to use is a matter of taste and both styles can be mixed depending on which is best for a specific actor. An actor can switch between behaviors implemented in different styles. For example, it may have an initial behavior that is only stashing messages until some initial query has been completed and then switching over to its main active behavior that is maintaining some mutable state. Such initial behavior is nice in the functional style and the active behavior may be better with the object-oriented style.\nWe would recommend using the tool that is best for the job. The APIs are similar in many ways to make it easy to learn both. You may of course also decide to just stick to one style for consistency and familiarity reasons.\nWhen developing in Scala the functional style will probably be the choice for many. Some reasons why you may want to use the functional style: You are familiar with a functional approach of structuring the code. Note that this API is still not using any advanced functional programming or type theory constructs. The state is immutable and can be passed to “next” behavior. The Behavior is stateless. The actor lifecycle has several different phases that can be represented by switching between different behaviors, like a finite state machine. This is also supported with the object-oriented style, but it’s typically nicer with the functional style. It’s less risk of accessing mutable state in the actor from other threads, like Future or Streams callbacks. Some reasons why you may want to use the object-oriented style: You are more familiar with an object-oriented style of structuring the code with methods in a class rather than functions. Some state is not immutable. It could be more familiar and easier to upgrade existing classic actors to this style. Mutable state can sometimes have better performance, e.g. mutable collections and avoiding allocating new instance for next behavior (be sure to benchmark if this is your motivation).\nWhen developing in Java the object-oriented style will probably be the choice for many. Some reasons why you may want to use the object-oriented style: You are more familiar with an object-oriented style of structuring the code with methods in a class rather than functions. Java lambdas can only close over final or effectively final fields, making it impractical to use the functional style in behaviors that mutate their fields. Some state is not immutable, e.g. immutable collections are not widely used in Java. It is OK to use mutable state also with the functional style but you must make sure that it’s not shared between different actor instances. It could be more familiar and easier to upgrade existing classic actors to this style.

One thing to be cautious with here is that it’s important that you create a new instance for each spawned actor, since those parameters must not be shared between different actor instances. That comes natural when creating the instance from Behaviors.setup as in the above example. Having a apply factory method in the companion object and making the constructor private is recommended. static create factory method and making the constructor private is recommended.\nThis can also be useful when testing the behavior by creating a test subclass that overrides certain methods in the class. The test would create the instance without the apply factory methodstatic create factory method. Then you need to relax the visibility constraints of the constructor and methods.\nIt’s not recommended to place mutable state and var membersnon-final members in the enclosing class. It would be correct from an actor thread-safety perspective as long as the same instance of the enclosing class is not shared between different actor instances, but if that is what you need you should rather use the object-oriented style with the AbstractBehavior class.\nSimilar can be achieved without an enclosing class by placing the def counter inside the Behaviors.setup block. That works fine, but for more complex behaviors it can be better to structure the methods in a class.

Consistent naming makes it easier for readers of the code to find the “starting point” of the behavior.\nIn the functional style the factory could even have been defined as a valstatic field if all state is immutable and captured by the function, but since most behaviors need some initialization parameters it is preferred to consistently use a method (def) for the factory.\nExample:\nScala copysourceobject CountDown {\n  sealed trait Command\n  case object Down extends Command\n\n  // factory for the initial `Behavior`\n  def apply(countDownFrom: Int, notifyWhenZero: ActorRef[Done]): Behavior[Command] =\n    new CountDown(notifyWhenZero).counter(countDownFrom)\n}\n\nprivate class CountDown(notifyWhenZero: ActorRef[Done]) {\n  import CountDown._\n\n  private def counter(remaining: Int): Behavior[Command] = {\n    Behaviors.receiveMessage {\n      case Down =>\n        if (remaining == 1) {\n          notifyWhenZero.tell(Done)\n          Behaviors.stopped\n        } else\n          counter(remaining - 1)\n    }\n  }\n\n} Java copysourcepublic class CountDown extends AbstractBehavior<CountDown.Command> {\n\n  public interface Command {}\n\n  public enum Down implements Command {\n    INSTANCE\n  }\n\n  // factory for the initial `Behavior`\n  public static Behavior<Command> create(int countDownFrom, ActorRef<Done> notifyWhenZero) {\n    return Behaviors.setup(context -> new CountDown(context, countDownFrom, notifyWhenZero));\n  }\n\n  private final ActorRef<Done> notifyWhenZero;\n  private int remaining;\n\n  private CountDown(\n      ActorContext<Command> context, int countDownFrom, ActorRef<Done> notifyWhenZero) {\n    super(context);\n    this.remaining = countDownFrom;\n    this.notifyWhenZero = notifyWhenZero;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive<Command> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder().onMessage(Down.class, notUsed -> onDown()).build();\n  }\n\n  private Behavior<Command> onDown() {\n    remaining--;\n    if (remaining == 0) {\n      notifyWhenZero.tell(Done.getInstance());\n      return Behaviors.stopped();\n    } else {\n      return this;\n    }\n  }\n}\nWhen spawning an actor from this initial behavior it looks like:\nScala copysourceval countDown = context.spawn(CountDown(100, doneRef), \"countDown\") Java copysourceActorRef<CountDown.Command> countDown =\n    context.spawn(CountDown.create(100, doneRef), \"countDown\");","title":"Behavior factory method"},{"location":"/typed/style-guide.html#where-to-define-messages","text":"When sending or receiving actor messages they should be prefixed with the name of the actor/behavior that defines them to avoid ambiguities.\nScala copysourcecountDown !

The former approach is recommended but it is good to know this alternative as it can be useful when using shared message protocol classes as described in Where to define messages.\nHere’s an example of using a type hierarchy to separate public and private messages:\nScala copysource// above example is preferred, but this is possible and not wrong\nobject Counter {\n  // The type of all public and private messages the Counter actor handles\n  sealed trait Message\n\n  /** Counter's public message protocol type. */\n  sealed trait Command extends Message\n  case object Increment extends Command\n  final case class GetValue(replyTo: ActorRef[Value]) extends Command\n  final case class Value(n: Int)\n\n  // The type of the Counter actor's internal messages.\n  sealed trait PrivateCommand extends Message\n  // Tick is a private command so can't be sent to an ActorRef[Command]\n  case object Tick extends PrivateCommand\n\n  def apply(name: String, tickInterval: FiniteDuration): Behavior[Command] = {\n    Behaviors\n      .setup[Counter.Message] { context =>\n        Behaviors.withTimers { timers =>\n          timers.startTimerWithFixedDelay(Tick, tickInterval)\n          new Counter(name, context).counter(0)\n        }\n      }\n      .narrow // note narrow here\n  }\n}\n\nclass Counter private (name: String, context: ActorContext[Counter.Message]) {\n  import Counter._\n\n  private def counter(n: Int): Behavior[Message] =\n    Behaviors.receiveMessage {\n      case Increment =>\n        val newValue = n + 1\n        context.log.debug2(\"[{}] Incremented counter to [{}]\", name, newValue)\n        counter(newValue)\n      case Tick =>\n        val newValue = n + 1\n        context.log.debug2(\"[{}] Incremented counter by background tick to [{}]\", name, newValue)\n        counter(newValue)\n      case GetValue(replyTo) =>\n        replyTo !

This improves readability and ease of method navigation with an IDE. The delegation can be with lambdas or method references. Example of delegation using a lambda: Java copysource@Override\npublic Receive<Command> createReceive() {\n  return newReceiveBuilder()\n      .onMessage(Increment.class, notUsed -> onIncrement())\n      .build();\n}\n\nprivate Behavior<Command> onIncrement() {\n  count++;\n  getContext().getLog().debug(\"[{}] Incremented counter to [{}]\", name, count);\n  return this;\n} When possible it’s preferred to use method references instead of lambdas. The benefit is less verbosity and in some cases it can actually give better type inference. Java copysource@Override\npublic Receive<Command> createReceive() {\n  return newReceiveBuilder()\n      .onMessage(GetValue.class, this::onGetValue)\n      .build();\n}\n\nprivate Behavior<Command> onGetValue(GetValue command) {\n  command.replyTo.tell(new Value(count));\n  return this;\n} this::onGetValue is a method reference in above example. It corresponds to command -> onGetValue(command). If you are using IntelliJ IDEA it has support for converting lambdas to method references. More important than the choice between lambdas or method references is to avoid lambdas with a large block of code. An anti-pattern would be to inline all message handling inside the lambdas like this: Java copysource// this is an anti-pattern, don't use lambdas with a large block of code\n  public Receive<Command> createReceive() {\n    return newReceiveBuilder()\n        .onMessage(\n            Increment.class,\n            notUsed -> {\n              count++;\n              getContext().getLog().debug(\"[{}] Incremented counter to [{}]\", name, count);\n              return this;\n            })\n        .onMessage(\n            Tick.class,\n            notUsed -> {\n              count++;\n              getContext()\n                  .getLog()\n                  .debug(\"[{}] Incremented counter by background tick to [{}]\", name, count);\n              return this;\n            })\n        .onMessage(\n            GetValue.class,\n            command -> {\n              command.replyTo.tell(new Value(count));\n              return this;\n            })\n        .build();\n  } In a real application it would often be more than 3 lines for each message. It’s not only making it more difficult to get an overview of the message matching, but compiler errors related to lambdas can sometimes be difficult to understand. Ideally, lambdas should be written in one line of code. Two lines can be ok, but three is probably too much. Also, don’t use braces and return statements in one-line lambda bodies.\nPartial versus total Function It’s recommended to use a sealed trait as the super type of the commands (incoming messages) of an actor as the compiler will emit a warning if a message type is forgotten in the pattern match. Scala copysourcesealed trait Command\ncase object Down extends Command\nfinal case class GetValue(replyTo: ActorRef[Value]) extends Command\nfinal case class Value(n: Int) That is the main reason for Behaviors.receive, Behaviors.receiveMessage taking a Function rather than a PartialFunction. The compiler warning if GetValue is not handled would be: [warn] ... Counter.scala:45:34: match may not be exhaustive.\n[warn] It would fail on the following input: GetValue(_)\n[warn]         Behaviors.receiveMessage {\n[warn]                                  ^\n Note that a MatchError will be thrown at runtime if a message is not handled, so it’s important to pay attention to those. If a Behavior should not handle certain messages you can still include them in the pattern match and return Behaviors.unhandled. Scala copysourceval zero: Behavior[Command] = {\n  Behaviors.receiveMessage {\n    case GetValue(replyTo) =>\n      replyTo ! Value(0)\n      Behaviors.same\n    case Down =>\n      Behaviors.unhandled\n  }\n} It’s recommended to use the sealed trait and total functions with exhaustiveness check to detect mistakes of forgetting to handle some messages. Sometimes, that can be inconvenient and then you can use a PartialFunction with Behaviors.receivePartial or Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial Scala copysourceval zero: Behavior[Command] = {\n  Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial {\n    case GetValue(replyTo) =>\n      replyTo ! Value(0)\n      Behaviors.same\n  }\n}\nHow to compose Partial Functions Following up from previous section, there are times when one might want to combine different PartialFunctions into one Behavior. A good use case for composing two or more PartialFunctions is when there is a bit of behavior that repeats across different states of the Actor. Below, you can find a simplified example for this use case. The Command definition is still highly recommended be kept within a sealed Trait: Scala copysourcesealed trait Command\ncase object Down extends Command\nfinal case class GetValue(replyTo: ActorRef[Value]) extends Command\nfinal case class Value(n: Int) In this particular case, the Behavior that is repeating over is the one in charge to handle the GetValue Command, as it behaves the same regardless of the Actor’s internal state. Instead of defining the specific handlers as a Behavior, we can define them as a PartialFunction: Scala copysourcedef getHandler(value: Int): PartialFunction[Command, Behavior[Command]] = {\n  case GetValue(replyTo) =>\n    replyTo ! Value(value)\n    Behaviors.same\n}\ndef setHandlerNotZero(value: Int): PartialFunction[Command, Behavior[Command]] = {\n  case Down =>\n    if (value == 1)\n      zero\n    else\n      nonZero(value - 1)\n}\ndef setHandlerZero(log: Logger): PartialFunction[Command, Behavior[Command]] = {\n  case Down =>\n    log.error(\"Counter is already at zero!\")\n    Behaviors.same\n} Finally, we can go on defining the two different behaviors for this specific actor. For each Behavior we would go and concatenate all needed PartialFunction instances with orElse to finally apply the command to the resulting one: Scala copysourceval zero: Behavior[Command] = Behaviors.setup { context =>\n  Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial(getHandler(0).orElse(setHandlerZero(context.log)))\n}\n\ndef nonZero(capacity: Int): Behavior[Command] =\n  Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial(getHandler(capacity).orElse(setHandlerNotZero(capacity)))\n\n// Default Initial Behavior for this actor\ndef apply(initialCapacity: Int): Behavior[Command] = nonZero(initialCapacity) Even though in this particular example we could use receiveMessage as we cover all cases, we use receiveMessagePartial instead to cover potential future unhandled message cases.\nask versus ? When using the AskPattern it’s recommended to use the ask method rather than the infix ? operator, like so: Scala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.AskPattern._\nimport pekko.util.Timeout\n\nimplicit val timeout: Timeout = Timeout(3.seconds)\nval counter: ActorRef[Command] = ???\n\nval result: Future[OperationResult] = counter.ask(replyTo => Increment(delta = 2, replyTo)) You may also use the more terse placeholder syntax _ instead of replyTo: Scala copysourceval result2: Future[OperationResult] = counter.ask(Increment(delta = 2, _)) However, using the infix operator ? with the placeholder syntax _, like is done in the following example, won’t typecheck because of the binding scope rules for wildcard parameters: Scala copysource// doesn't compile\nval result3: Future[OperationResult] = counter ? Increment(delta = 2, _) Adding the necessary parentheses (as shown below) makes it typecheck, but, subjectively, it’s rather ugly so the recommendation is to use ask. Scala copysourceval result3: Future[OperationResult] = counter ? (Increment(delta = 2, _)) Note that AskPattern is only intended for request-response interaction from outside an actor. If the requester is inside an actor, prefer ActorContext.ask as it provides better thread-safety by not requiring the use of a FutureCompletionStage inside the actor.\nReceiveBuilder Using the ReceiveBuilder is the typical, and recommended, way of defining message handlers, but it can be good to know that it’s optional in case you would prefer a different approach. Alternatives could be like: direct processing because there is only one message type if or switch statements annotation processor Vavr Pattern Matching DSL pattern matching since JDK 14 (JEP 305) In Behaviors there are receive, receiveMessage and receiveSignal factory methods that takes functions instead of using the ReceiveBuilder, which is the receive with the class parameter. In AbstractBehavior you can return your own org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.javadsl.Receive from createReceive instead of using newReceiveBuilder. Implement the receiveMessage and receiveSignal in the Receive subclass.","title":"Public versus private messages"},{"location":"/typed/style-guide.html#nesting-setup","text":"When an actor behavior needs more than one of setup, withTimers and withStash the methods can be nested to access the needed dependencies:\nScala copysourcedef apply(): Behavior[Command] =\n  Behaviors.setup[Command](context =>\n    Behaviors.withStash(100)(stash =>\n      Behaviors.withTimers { timers =>\n        context.log.debug(\"Starting up\")\n\n        // behavior using context, stash and timers ...\n      })) Java copysourcepublic static Behavior<Command> apply() {\n  return Behaviors.setup(\n      context ->\n          Behaviors.withStash(\n              100,\n              stash ->\n                  Behaviors.withTimers(\n                      timers -> {\n                        context.getLog().debug(\"Starting up\");\n\n                        // behavior using context, stash and timers ...\n                      })));\n}\nThe order of the nesting does not change the behavior as long as there is no additional logic in any other function than the innermost one.

After processing a message, a different Behavior may be returned for processing the next message. This means that an actor is started with an initial Behavior and may change Behavior over its lifecycle. This is described more in the section about become.\nNote that the Behavior has a type parameter describing the type of messages that it can handle.

Instead, there is a single top level actor defined by a user guardian Behavior that is given when starting the ActorSystem. Other actors are started as children of that user guardian actor or children of other actors in the actor hierarchy. This is explained more in ActorSystem.\nNote that when mixing classic and typed and have a classic system, spawning top level actors from the side is possible, see Coexistence.\nThe actorOf method takes an org.apache.pekko.actor.Props parameter, which is like a factory for creating the actor instance, and it’s also used when creating a new instance when the actor is restarted. The Props may also define additional properties such as which dispatcher to use for the actor.\nIn typed, the spawn method creates an actor directly from a given Behavior without using a Props factory. It does however accept an optional org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.Props for specifying Actor metadata. The factory aspect is instead defined via Behaviors.setup when using the object-oriented style with a class extending AbstractBehavior. For the function style there is typically no need for the factory.\nAdditional properties such as which dispatcher to use for the actor can still be given via an optional org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.Props parameter of the spawn method.\nThe name parameter of actorOf is optional and if not defined the actor will have a generated name.

One difference is that when creating an ActorSystem in Typed you give it a Behavior that will be used as the top level actor, also known as the user guardian.\nAdditional actors for an application are created from the user guardian alongside performing the initialization of Pekko components such as Cluster Sharding. In contrast, in a classic ActorSystem, such initialization is typically performed from the “outside”.\nThe actorOf method of the classic ActorSystem is typically used to create a few (or many) top level actors. The ActorSystem in Typed doesn’t have that capability. Instead, such actors are started as children of the user guardian actor or children of other actors in the actor hierarchy. The rationale for this is partly about consistency. In a typed system you can’t create children to an arbitrary actor from anywhere in your app without messaging it, so this will also hold true for the user guardian actor. That noted, in cases where you do need to spawn outside of this guardian then you can use the SpawnProtocol to spawn as needed.","title":"ActorSystem"},{"location":"/typed/from-classic.html#become","text":"A classic actor can change its message processing behavior by using become in ActorContext.

Graceful exit can also be performed using HTTP or JMX.

Tasks for graceful leaving of cluster, including graceful shutdown of Cluster Singletons and Cluster Sharding, are added automatically when Pekko Cluster is used. For example, running the shutdown process will also trigger the graceful leaving if not already in progress.\nNormally this is handled automatically, but in case of network failures during this process it may still be necessary to set the node’s status to Down in order to complete the removal, see Downing.","title":"Leaving"},{"location":"/typed/cluster.html#downing","text":"In many cases a member can gracefully exit from the cluster, as described in Leaving, but there are scenarios when an explicit downing decision is needed before it can be removed.

In such cases, the node(s) will be detected as unreachable by other nodes, but they must also be marked as Down before they are removed.\nWhen a member is considered by the failure detector to be unreachable the leader is not allowed to perform its duties, such as changing status of new joining members to ‘Up’. The node must first become reachable again, or the status of the unreachable member must be changed to Down. Changing status to Down can be performed automatically or manually.\nWe recommend that you enable the Split Brain Resolver that is part of the Pekko Cluster module.

This is when a node can prove that the cluster state it is observing has been observed by all other nodes in the cluster. Convergence is implemented by passing a set of nodes that have seen current state version during gossip. This information is referred to as the seen set in the gossip overview. When all nodes are included in the seen set there is convergence.\nGossip convergence cannot occur while any nodes are unreachable. The nodes need to become reachable again, or moved to the down and removed states (see the Cluster Membership Lifecycle section). This only blocks the leader from performing its cluster membership management and does not influence the application running on top of the cluster. For example this means that during a network partition it is not possible to add more nodes to the cluster. The nodes can join, but they will not be moved to the up state until the partition has healed or the unreachable nodes have been downed.","title":"Gossip Convergence"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-concepts.html#failure-detector","text":"The failure detector in Pekko Cluster is responsible for trying to detect if a node is unreachable from the rest of the cluster. For this we are using the Phi Accrual Failure Detector implementation. To be able to survive sudden abnormalities, such as garbage collection pauses and transient network failures the failure detector is easily configurable for tuning to your environments and needs.\nIn a cluster each node is monitored by a few (default maximum 5) other nodes. The nodes to monitor are selected from neighbors in a hashed ordered node ring. This is to increase the likelihood to monitor across racks and data centers, but the order is the same on all nodes, which ensures full coverage.\nWhen any node is detected to be unreachable this data is spread to the rest of the cluster through the gossip. In other words, only one node needs to mark a node unreachable to have the rest of the cluster mark that node unreachable.\nThe failure detector will also detect if the node becomes reachable again. When all nodes that monitored the unreachable node detect it as reachable again the cluster, after gossip dissemination, will consider it as reachable.\nIf system messages cannot be delivered to a node it will be quarantined and then it cannot come back from unreachable. This can happen if the there are too many unacknowledged system messages (e.g. watch, Terminated, remote actor deployment, failures of actors supervised by remote parent). Then the node needs to be moved to the down or removed states (see Cluster Membership Lifecycle) and the actor system of the quarantined node must be restarted before it can join the cluster again.\nSee the following for more details:\nPhi Accrual Failure Detector implementation Using the Failure Detector","title":"Failure Detector"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-concepts.html#leader","text":"After gossip convergence a leader for the cluster can be determined.

The leader is the first node in sorted order that is able to take the leadership role, where the preferred member states for a leader are up and leaving (see the Cluster Membership Lifecycle for more information about member states).\nThe role of the leader is to shift members in and out of the cluster, changing joining members to the up state or exiting members to the removed state. Currently leader actions are only triggered by receiving a new cluster state with gossip convergence.","title":"Leader"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-concepts.html#seed-nodes","text":"The seed nodes are contact points for new nodes joining the cluster.

In push-pull gossip a digest is sent representing current versions but not actual values; the recipient of the gossip can then send back any values for which it has newer versions and also request values for which it has outdated versions. Pekko uses a single shared state with a vector clock for versioning, so the variant of push-pull gossip used in Pekko makes use of this version to only push the actual state as needed.\nPeriodically, the default is every 1 second, each node chooses another random node to initiate a round of gossip with. If less than ½ of the nodes resides in the seen set (have seen the new state) then the cluster gossips 3 times instead of once every second. This adjusted gossip interval is a way to speed up the convergence process in the early dissemination phase after a state change.\nThe choice of node to gossip with is random but biased towards nodes that might not have seen the current state version. During each round of gossip exchange, when convergence is not yet reached, a node uses a very high probability (which is configurable) to gossip with another node which is not part of the seen set, i.e. which is likely to have an older version of the state. Otherwise it gossips with any random live node.\nThis biased selection is a way to speed up the convergence process in the late dissemination phase after a state change.\nFor clusters larger than 400 nodes (configurable, and suggested by empirical evidence) the 0.8 probability is gradually reduced to avoid overwhelming single stragglers with too many concurrent gossip requests. The gossip receiver also has a mechanism to protect itself from too many simultaneous gossip messages by dropping messages that have been enqueued in the mailbox for too long of a time.\nWhile the cluster is in a converged state the gossiper only sends a small gossip status message containing the gossip version to the chosen node. As soon as there is a change to the cluster (meaning non-convergence) then it goes back to biased gossip again.\nThe recipient of the gossip state or the gossip status can use the gossip version (vector clock) to determine whether:\nit has a newer version of the gossip state, in which case it sends that back to the gossiper it has an outdated version of the state, in which case the recipient requests the current state from the gossiper by sending back its version of the gossip state it has conflicting gossip versions, in which case the different versions are merged and sent back\nIf the recipient and the gossip have the same version then the gossip state is not sent or requested.\nThe periodic nature of the gossip has a nice batching effect of state changes, e.g. joining several nodes quickly after each other to one node will result in only one state change to be spread to other members in the cluster.\nThe gossip messages are serialized with protobuf and also gzipped to reduce payload size.","title":"Gossip Protocol"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-membership.html","text":"","title":"Cluster Membership Service"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-membership.html#cluster-membership-service","text":"The core of Apache Pekko Cluster is the cluster membership, to keep track of what nodes are part of the cluster and their health.

Joining a cluster is initiated by issuing a Join command to one of the nodes in the cluster to join.\nThe node identifier internally also contains a UID that uniquely identifies this actor system instance at that hostname:port. Pekko uses the UID to be able to reliably trigger remote death watch. This means that the same actor system can never join a cluster again once it’s been removed from that cluster.

Once all nodes have seen that the new node is joining (through gossip convergence) the leader will set the member state to up.\nIf a node is leaving the cluster in a safe, expected manner, for example through coordinated shutdown, it invokes the leave action which switches it to the leaving state. Once the leader sees the convergence on the node in the leaving state, the leader will then move it to exiting. Once all nodes have seen the exiting state (convergence) the leader will remove the node from the cluster, marking it as removed.\nIf a node is unreachable then gossip convergence is not possible and therefore most leader actions are impossible (for instance, allowing a node to become a part of the cluster). To be able to move forward, the node must become reachable again or the node must be explicitly “downed”. This is required because the state of an unreachable node is unknown and the cluster cannot know if the node has crashed or is only temporarily unreachable because of network issues or GC pauses. See the section about User Actions below for ways a node can be downed.\nThe actor system on a node that exited or was downed cannot join the cluster again. In particular, a node that was downed while being unreachable and then regains connectivity cannot rejoin the cluster. Instead, the process has to be restarted on the node, creating a new actor system that can go through the joining process again.\nA special case is a node that was restarted without going through the leaving or downing process e.g. because the machine hosting the node was unexpectedly restarted. When the new instance of the node tries to rejoin the cluster, the cluster might still track the old instance as unreachable. In this case, however, it is clear that the old node is gone because the new instance will have the same address (host and port) as its old instance. In this case, the previous instance will be automatically marked as down and the new instance can rejoin the cluster without manual intervention.","title":"Membership Lifecycle"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-membership.html#leader","text":"The purpose of the leader is to confirm state changes when convergence is reached. The leader can be determined by each node unambiguously after gossip convergence. Any node might be required to take the role of the leader depending on the current cluster composition.\nWithout convergence, different nodes might have different views about which node is the leader. Therefore, most leader actions are only allowed if there is convergence to ensure that all nodes agree about the current state of the cluster and state changes are originated from a single node. Most regular state changes like changing a node from joining to up are of that kind.\nOther situations require that an action is taken even if convergence cannot be reached currently. Notably, convergence cannot be reached if one or more nodes in the cluster are currently unreachable as determined by the failure detector. In such a case, the cluster might be partitioned (a split brain scenario) and each partition might have its own view about which nodes are reachable and which are not. In this case, a node on each side of the partition might view itself as the leader of the reachable nodes. Any action that the leader performs in such a case must be designed in a way that all concurrent leaders would come to the same conclusion (which might be impossible in general and only feasible under additional constraints). The most important case of that kind is a split brain scenario where nodes need to be downed, either manually or automatically, to bring the cluster back to convergence.\nThe Split Brain Resolver is the built-in implementation of that.\nAnother transition that is possible without convergence is marking members as WeaklyUp as described in the next section.","title":"Leader"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-membership.html#weaklyup-members","text":"If a node is unreachable then gossip convergence is not possible and therefore most leader actions are impossible.

They are performed in a request/reply handshake, and the replies are input to the failure detector.\nThe suspicion level of failure is represented by a value called phi. The basic idea of the phi failure detector is to express the value of phi on a scale that is dynamically adjusted to reflect current network conditions.\nThe value of phi is calculated as:\nphi = -log10(1 - F(timeSinceLastHeartbeat))\nwhere F is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation estimated from historical heartbeat inter-arrival times.\nAn accrual failure detector decouples monitoring and interpretation. That makes them applicable to a wider area of scenarios and more adequate to build generic failure detection services. The idea is that it is keeping a history of failure statistics, calculated from heartbeats received from other nodes, and is trying to do educated guesses by taking multiple factors, and how they accumulate over time, into account in order to come up with a better guess if a specific node is up or down. Rather than only answering “yes” or “no” to the question “is the node down?” it returns a phi value representing the likelihood that the node is down.\nThe following chart illustrates how phi increase with increasing time since the previous heartbeat.\nPhi is calculated from the mean and standard deviation of historical inter arrival times. The previous chart is an example for standard deviation of 200 ms. If the heartbeats arrive with less deviation the curve becomes steeper, i.e. it is possible to determine failure more quickly. The curve looks like this for a standard deviation of 100 ms.\nTo be able to survive sudden abnormalities, such as garbage collection pauses and transient network failures the failure detector is configured with a margin, which you may want to adjust depending on you environment.

Replicator"},{"location":"/typed/distributed-data.html#update","text":"To modify and replicate a data value you send a Replicator.Update message to the local Replicator.\nIn the above example, for an incoming Increment command, we send the replicator a Replicator.Update request, it contains five values:\nthe KeyKEY we want to update the data to use as the empty state if the replicator has not seen the key before the write consistency level we want for the update an ActorRef[Replicator.UpdateResponse[GCounter]]ActorRef<Replicator.UpdateResponse<GCounter>> to respond to when the update is completed a modify function that takes a previous state and updates it, in our case by incrementing it with 1\nThere is alternative way of constructing the function for the Update message: Scala copysource// alternative way to define the `createRequest` function\n// Replicator.Update instance has a curried `apply` method\nreplicatorAdapter.askUpdate(\n  Replicator.Update(key, GCounter.empty,

askReplyTo)(_ :+ 1),\n  InternalUpdateResponse.apply)\nThe current data value for the key of the Update is passed as parameter to the modify function of the Update. The function is supposed to return the new value of the data, which will then be replicated according to the given write consistency level.\nThe modify function is called by the Replicator actor and must therefore be a pure function that only uses the data parameter and stable fields from enclosing scope. It must for example not access the ActorContext or mutable state of an enclosing actor. Update is intended to only be sent from an actor running in same local ActorSystem as the Replicator, because the modify function is typically not serializable.\nYou will always see your own writes. For example if you send two Update messages changing the value of the same key, the modify function of the second message will see the change that was performed by the first Update message.\nAs reply of the Update a Replicator.UpdateSuccess is sent to the replyTo of the Update if the value was successfully replicated according to the supplied consistency level within the supplied timeout. Otherwise a Replicator.UpdateFailure subclass is sent back. Note that a Replicator.UpdateTimeout reply does not mean that the update completely failed or was rolled back. It may still have been replicated to some nodes, and will eventually be replicated to all nodes with the gossip protocol.\nIt is possible to abort the Update when inspecting the state parameter that is passed in to the modify function by throwing an exception. That happens before the update is performed and a Replicator.ModifyFailure is sent back as reply.","title":"Update"},{"location":"/typed/distributed-data.html#get","text":"To retrieve the current value of a data you send Replicator.Get message to the Replicator.\nThe example has the GetValue command, which is asking the replicator for current value.

For example if you send a Update message followed by a Get of the same key the Get will retrieve the change that was performed by the preceding Update message. However, the order of the reply messages are not defined, i.e. in the previous example you may receive the GetSuccess before the UpdateSuccess.\nAs reply of the Get a Replicator.GetSuccess is sent to the replyTo of the Get if the value was successfully retrieved according to the supplied consistency level within the supplied timeout.

Since this is not a message in our protocol, we use a message transformation function to wrap it in the internal InternalSubscribeResponse message, which is then handled in the regular message handling of the behavior, as shown in the above example. Subscribers will be notified of changes, if there are any, based on the configurable pekko.cluster.distributed-data.notify-subscribers-interval.\nThe subscriber is automatically unsubscribed if the subscriber is terminated.

It may still have been replicated to some nodes, and may eventually be replicated to all nodes.\nA deleted key cannot be reused again, but it is still recommended to delete unused data entries because that reduces the replication overhead when new nodes join the cluster. Subsequent Delete, Update and Get requests will be replied with Replicator.DataDeleted. Subscribers will receive Replicator.Deleted.\nWarning As deleted keys continue to be included in the stored data on each node as well as in gossip messages, a continuous series of updates and deletes of top-level entities will result in growing memory usage until an ActorSystem runs out of memory.

The Replicator writes and reads to a majority of replicas, i.e. N / 2 + 1. For example, in a 5 node cluster it writes to 3 nodes and reads from 3 nodes. In a 6 node cluster it writes to 4 nodes and reads from 4 nodes.\nYou can define a minimum number of nodes for WriteMajority and ReadMajority, this will minimize the risk of reading stale data. Minimum cap is provided by minCap property of WriteMajority and ReadMajority and defines the required majority. If the minCap is higher then N / 2 + 1 the minCap will be used.\nFor example if the minCap is 5 the WriteMajority and ReadMajority for cluster of 3 nodes will be 3, for cluster of 6 nodes will be 5 and for cluster of 12 nodes will be 7 ( N / 2 + 1 ).\nFor small clusters (<7) the risk of membership changes between a WriteMajority and ReadMajority is rather high and then the nice properties of combining majority write and reads are not guaranteed. Therefore the ReadMajority and WriteMajority have a minCap parameter that is useful to specify to achieve better safety for small clusters. It means that if the cluster size is smaller than the majority size it will use the minCap number of nodes but at most the total size of the cluster.\nIn some rare cases, when performing an Update it is needed to first try to fetch latest data from other nodes. That can be done by first sending a Get with ReadMajority and then continue with the Update when the GetSuccess, GetFailure or NotFound reply is received. This might be needed when you need to base a decision on latest information or when removing entries from an ORSet or ORMap. If an entry is added to an ORSet or ORMap from one node and removed from another node the entry will only be removed if the added entry is visible on the node where the removal is performed (hence the name observed-removed set).\nWarning Caveat: Even if you use WriteMajority and ReadMajority there is small risk that you may read stale data if the cluster membership has changed between the Update and the Get. For example, in cluster of 5 nodes when you Update and that change is written to 3 nodes: n1, n2, n3. Then 2 more nodes are added and a Get request is reading from 4 nodes, which happens to be n4, n5, n6, n7, i.e. the value on n1, n2, n3 is not seen in the response of the Get request.

This is the same semantics as for the ORSet.\nIf an entry is concurrently updated to different values the values will be merged, hence the requirement that the values must be ReplicatedData types.\nWhile the ORMap supports removing and re-adding keys any number of times, the impact that this has on the values can be non-deterministic. A merge will always attempt to merge two values for the same key, regardless of whether that key has been removed and re-added in the meantime, an attempt to replace a value with a new one may not have the intended effect. This means that old values can effectively be resurrected if a node, that has seen both the remove and the update,gossips with a node that has seen neither. One consequence of this is that changing the value type of the CRDT, for example, from a GCounter to a GSet, could result in the merge function for the CRDT always failing. This could be an unrecoverable state for the node, hence, the types of ORMap values must never change for a given key.\nIt is rather inconvenient to use the ORMap directly since it does not expose specific types of the values. The ORMap is intended as a low level tool for building more specific maps, such as the following specialized maps.\nORMultiMap (observed-remove multi-map) is a multi-map implementation that wraps an ORMap with an ORSet for the map’s value.\nPNCounterMap (positive negative counter map) is a map of named counters (where the name can be of any type). It is a specialized ORMap with PNCounter values.\nLWWMap (last writer wins map) is a specialized ORMap with LWWRegister (last writer wins register) values.\nORMap, ORMultiMap, PNCounterMap and LWWMap have support for delta-CRDT and they require causal delivery of deltas. Support for deltas here means that the ORSet being underlying key type for all those maps uses delta propagation to deliver updates. Effectively, the update for map is then a pair, consisting of delta for the ORSet being the key and full update for the respective value (ORSet, PNCounter or LWWRegister) kept in the map.\nScala copysourceimplicit val node = DistributedData(system).selfUniqueAddress\nval m0 = ORMultiMap.empty[String, Int]\nval m1 = m0 :+ (\"a\" -> Set(1, 2, 3))\nval m2 = m1.addBinding(node, \"a\", 4)\nval m3 = m2.removeBinding(node, \"a\", 2)\nval m4 = m3.addBinding(node, \"b\", 1)\nprintln(m4.entries) Java copysourcefinal SelfUniqueAddress node = DistributedData.get(system).selfUniqueAddress();\nfinal ORMultiMap<String, Integer> m0 = ORMultiMap.create();\nfinal ORMultiMap<String, Integer> m1 = m0.put(node, \"a\", new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3)));\nfinal ORMultiMap<String, Integer> m2 = m1.addBinding(node, \"a\", 4);\nfinal ORMultiMap<String, Integer> m3 = m2.removeBinding(node, \"a\", 2);\nfinal ORMultiMap<String, Integer> m4 = m3.addBinding(node, \"b\", 1);\nSystem.out.println(m4.getEntries());\nWhen a data entry is changed the full state of that entry is replicated to other nodes, i.e. when you update a map, the whole map is replicated. Therefore, instead of using one ORMap with 1000 elements it is more efficient to split that up in 10 top level ORMap entries with 100 elements each. Top level entries are replicated individually, which has the trade-off that different entries may not be replicated at the same time and you may see inconsistencies between related entries. Separate top level entries cannot be updated atomically together.\nThere is a special version of ORMultiMap, created by using separate constructor ORMultiMap.emptyWithValueDeltas[A, B], that also propagates the updates to its values (of ORSet type) as deltas. This means that the ORMultiMap initiated with ORMultiMap.emptyWithValueDeltas propagates its updates as pairs consisting of delta of the key and delta of the value. It is much more efficient in terms of network bandwidth consumed.\nHowever, this behavior has not been made default for ORMultiMap and if you wish to use it in your code, you need to replace invocations of ORMultiMap.empty[A, B] (or ORMultiMap()) with ORMultiMap.emptyWithValueDeltas[A, B] where A and B are types respectively of keys and values in the map.\nPlease also note, that despite having the same Scala type, ORMultiMap.emptyWithValueDeltas is not compatible with ‘vanilla’ ORMultiMap, because of different replication mechanism. One needs to be extra careful not to mix the two, as they have the same type, so compiler will not hint the error. Nonetheless ORMultiMap.emptyWithValueDeltas uses the same ORMultiMapKey type as the ‘vanilla’ ORMultiMap for referencing.\nNote that LWWRegister and therefore LWWMap relies on synchronized clocks and should only be used when the choice of value is not important for concurrent updates occurring within the clock skew.

Otherwise it is only eventually consistent. Without causal consistency it means that if elements 'c' and 'd' are added in two separate Update operations these deltas may occasionally be propagated to nodes in a different order to the causal order of the updates.

The stored data will be loaded next time the replicator is started, i.e. when actor system is restarted.

If using a dynamically assigned port (0) it will be different each time and the previously stored data will not be loaded.\nMaking the data durable has a performance cost. By default, each update is flushed to disk before the UpdateSuccess reply is sent. For better performance, but with the risk of losing the last writes if the JVM crashes, you can enable write behind mode. Changes are then accumulated during a time period before it is written to LMDB and flushed to disk. Enabling write behind is especially efficient when performing many writes to the same key, because it is only the last value for each key that will be serialized and stored. The risk of losing writes if the JVM crashes is small since the data is typically replicated to other nodes immediately according to the given WriteConsistency.\npekko.cluster.distributed-data.durable.lmdb.write-behind-interval = 200 ms\nNote that you should be prepared to receive WriteFailure as reply to an Update of a durable entry if the data could not be stored for some reason. When enabling write-behind-interval such errors will only be logged and UpdateSuccess will still be the reply to the Update.\nThere is one important caveat when it comes pruning of CRDT Garbage for durable data. If an old data entry that was never pruned is injected and merged with existing data after that the pruning markers have been removed the value will not be correct. The time-to-live of the markers is defined by configuration pekko.cluster.distributed-data.durable.remove-pruning-marker-after and is in the magnitude of days. This would be possible if a node with durable data didn’t participate in the pruning (e.g. it was shutdown) and later started after this time.

After Downing and removing that node the a new oldest node will take over and a new singleton actor is created.

ClusterSingleton.init can be called multiple times, if there already is a singleton manager running on this node, no additional manager is started, and if there is one running an ActorRef to the proxy is returned.\nThe proxy will route all messages to the current instance of the singleton, and keep track of the oldest node in the cluster and discover the singleton’s ActorRef. There might be periods of time during which the singleton is unavailable, e.g., when a node leaves the cluster. In these cases, the proxy will buffer the messages sent to the singleton and then deliver them when the singleton is finally available. If the buffer is full the proxy will drop old messages when new messages are sent via the proxy. The size of the buffer is configurable and it can be disabled by using a buffer size of 0.\nIt’s worth noting that messages can always be lost because of the distributed nature of these actors.

Here we call these actors “entities”. These actors typically have persistent (durable) state, but this feature is not limited to actors with persistent state.\nCluster sharding is typically used when you have many stateful actors that together consume more resources (e.g. memory) than fit on one machine. If you only have a few stateful actors it might be easier to run them on a Cluster Singleton node.\nIn this context sharding means that actors with an identifier, so called entities, can be automatically distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster. Each entity actor runs only at one place, and messages can be sent to the entity without requiring the sender to know the location of the destination actor. This is achieved by sending the messages via a ShardRegion actor provided by this extension, which knows how to route the message with the entity id to the final destination.\nCluster sharding will not be active on members with status WeaklyUp if that feature is enabled.\nWarning Make sure to not use a Cluster downing strategy that may split the cluster into several separate clusters in case of network problems or system overload (long GC pauses), since that will result in multiple shards and entities being started, one in each separate cluster!

The grouping is typically defined by a hashing function of the entityId. For a specific entity identifier the shard identifier must always be the same. Otherwise the entity actor might accidentally be started in several places at the same time.\nBy default the shard identifier is the absolute value of the hashCode of the entity identifier modulo the total number of shards. The number of shards is configured by:\ncopysourcepekko.cluster.sharding {\n  # Number of shards used by the default HashCodeMessageExtractor\n  # when no other message extractor is defined. This value must be\n  # the same for all nodes in the cluster and that is verified by\n  # configuration check when joining. Changing the value requires\n  # stopping all nodes in the cluster.\n  number-of-shards = 1000\n}\nAs a rule of thumb, the number of shards should be a factor ten greater than the planned maximum number of cluster nodes. It doesn’t have to be exact. Fewer shards than number of nodes will result in that some nodes will not host any shards. Too many shards will result in less efficient management of the shards, e.g. rebalancing overhead, and increased latency because the coordinator is involved in the routing of the first message for each shard.\nThe number-of-shards configuration value must be the same for all nodes in the cluster and that is verified by configuration check when joining. Changing the value requires stopping all nodes in the cluster.\nThe shards are allocated to the nodes in the cluster. The decision of where to allocate a shard is done by a shard allocation strategy.\nThe default implementation LeastShardAllocationStrategy allocates new shards to the ShardRegion (node) with least number of previously allocated shards. This strategy can be replaced by an application specific implementation.\nWhen a node is added to the cluster the shards on the existing nodes will be rebalanced to the new node. The LeastShardAllocationStrategy picks shards for rebalancing from the ShardRegions with most number of previously allocated shards. They will then be allocated to the ShardRegion with least number of previously allocated shards, i.e. new members in the cluster. The amount of shards to rebalance in each round can be limited to make it progress slower since rebalancing too many shards at the same time could result in additional load on the system. For example, causing many Event Sourced entites to be started at the same time.\nA new rebalance algorithm is included in Pekko. It can reach optimal balance in a few rebalance rounds (typically 1 or 2 rounds). For backwards compatibility the new algorithm is not enabled by default. The new algorithm is recommended and will become the default in future versions of Pekko. You enable the new algorithm by setting rebalance-absolute-limit > 0, for example:\npekko.cluster.sharding.least-shard-allocation-strategy.rebalance-absolute-limit = 20\nThe rebalance-absolute-limit is the maximum number of shards that will be rebalanced in one rebalance round.\nYou may also want to tune the pekko.cluster.sharding.least-shard-allocation-strategy.rebalance-relative-limit. The rebalance-relative-limit is a fraction (< 1.0) of total number of (known) shards that will be rebalanced in one rebalance round. The lower result of rebalance-relative-limit and rebalance-absolute-limit will be used.","title":"Shard allocation"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-sharding.html#external-shard-allocation","text":"An alternative allocation strategy is the ExternalShardAllocationStrategyExternalShardAllocationStrategy which allows explicit control over where shards are allocated via the ExternalShardAllocationExternalShardAllocation extension.\nThis can be used, for example, to match up Kafka Partition consumption with shard locations.

During the rebalance process the coordinator will not answer any requests for the location of shards that are being rebalanced, i.e. local buffering will continue until the handoff is completed. The ShardRegion responsible for the rebalanced shard will stop all entities in that shard by sending the specified stopMessage (default PoisonPill) to them.

Serve requests from a location near the user to provide better responsiveness. Balance the load over many servers.\nIt’s possible to run an ordinary Pekko Cluster with default settings that spans multiple data centers but that may result in problems like:\nManagement of Cluster membership is stalled during network partitions as described in a separate section below. This means that nodes would not be able to be added and removed during network partitions between data centers. More frequent false positive failure detection for network connections across data centers. It’s not possible to have different settings for the failure detection within vs. across data centers. Downing/removal of nodes in the case of network partitions should typically be treated differently for failures within vs. across data centers. For network partitions between data centers the system should typically not down the unreachable nodes, but instead wait until it heals or a decision is made by a human or external monitoring system. For failures within same data center automatic, more aggressive, downing mechanisms can be employed for quick fail over. Quick fail over of Cluster Singleton and Cluster Sharding from one data center to another is difficult to do in a safe way. There is a risk that singletons or sharded entities become active on both sides of a network partition. Lack of location information makes it difficult to optimize communication to prefer nodes that are close over distant nodes. E.g. a cluster aware router would be more efficient if it would prefer routing messages to nodes in the own data center.\nTo avoid some of these problems one can run a separate Pekko Cluster per data center and use another communication channel between the data centers, such as HTTP, an external message broker. However, many of the nice tools that are built on top of the Cluster membership information are lost. For example, it wouldn’t be possible to use Distributed Data across the separate clusters.\nWe often recommend implementing a micro-service as one Pekko Cluster. The external API of the service would be HTTP, gRPC or a message broker, and not Pekko Remoting or Cluster (see additional discussion in When and where to use Pekko Cluster).\nThe internal communication within the service that is running on several nodes would use ordinary actor messaging or the tools based on Pekko Cluster. When deploying this service to multiple data centers it would be inconvenient if the internal communication could not use ordinary actor messaging because it was separated into several Pekko Clusters. The benefit of using Pekko messaging internally is performance as well as ease of development and reasoning about your domain in terms of Actors.\nTherefore, it’s possible to make the Pekko Cluster aware of data centers so that one Pekko Cluster can span multiple data centers and still be tolerant to network partitions.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-dc.html#defining-the-data-centers","text":"The features are based on the idea that nodes can be assigned to a group of nodes by setting the pekko.cluster.multi-data-center.self-data-center configuration property.

These actions cannot be performed while there are any unreachability observations among the nodes in the data center, but unreachability across different data centers don’t influence the progress of membership management within a data center. Nodes can be added and removed also when there are network partitions between data centers, which is impossible if nodes are not grouped into data centers.\nUser actions like joining, leaving, and downing can be sent to any node in the cluster, not only to the nodes in the data center of the node. Seed nodes are also global.\nThe data center membership is implemented by adding the data center name prefixed with \"dc-\" to the roles of the member and thereby this information is known by all other members in the cluster. This is an implementation detail, but it can be good to know if you see this in log messages.\nYou can retrieve information about what data center a member belongs to:\nScala copysourceval cluster = Cluster(system)\n// this node's data center\nval dc = cluster.selfMember.dataCenter\n// all known data centers\nval allDc = cluster.state.allDataCenters\n// a specific member's data center\nval aMember = cluster.state.members.head\nval aDc = aMember.dataCenter Java copysourcefinal Cluster cluster = Cluster.get(system);\n// this node's data center\nString dc = cluster.selfMember().dataCenter();\n// all known data centers\nSet<String> allDc = cluster.state().getAllDataCenters();\n// a specific member's data center\nMember aMember = cluster.state().getMembers().iterator().next();\nString aDc = aMember.dataCenter();","title":"Membership"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-dc.html#failure-detection","text":"Failure detection is performed by sending heartbeat messages to detect if a node is unreachable. This is done more frequently and with more certainty among the nodes in the same data center than across data centers. The failure detection across different data centers should be interpreted as an indication of problem with the network link between the data centers.\nTwo different failure detectors can be configured for these two purposes:\npekko.cluster.failure-detector for failure detection within own data center pekko.cluster.multi-data-center.failure-detector for failure detection across different data centers\nWhen subscribing to cluster events the UnreachableMember and ReachableMember events are for observations within the own data center. The same data center as where the subscription was registered.\nFor cross data center unreachability notifications you can subscribe to UnreachableDataCenter and ReachableDataCenter events.\nHeartbeat messages for failure detection across data centers are only performed between a number of the oldest nodes on each side. The number of nodes is configured with pekko.cluster.multi-data-center.cross-data-center-connections. The reason for only using a limited number of nodes is to keep the number of connections across data centers low. The same nodes are also used for the gossip protocol when disseminating the membership information across data centers. Within a data center all nodes are involved in gossip and failure detection.\nThis influences how rolling updates should be performed. Don’t stop all of the oldest that are used for gossip at the same time. Stop one or a few at a time so that new nodes can take over the responsibility. It’s best to leave the oldest nodes until last.\nSee the failure detector for more details.","title":"Failure Detection"},{"location":"/typed/cluster-dc.html#cluster-singleton","text":"The Cluster Singleton is a singleton per data center. If you start the ClusterSingletonManager on all nodes and you have defined 3 different data centers there will be 3 active singleton instances in the cluster, one in each data center. This is taken care of automatically, but is important to be aware of. Designing the system for one singleton per data center makes it possible for the system to be available also during network partitions between data centers.\nThe reason why the singleton is per data center and not global is that membership information is not guaranteed to be consistent across data centers when using one leader per data center and that makes it difficult to select a single global singleton.\nIf you need a global singleton you have to pick one data center to host that singleton and only start the ClusterSingletonManager on nodes of that data center. If the data center is unreachable from another data center the singleton is inaccessible, which is a reasonable trade-off when selecting consistency over availability.\nThe singleton proxy is by default routing messages to the singleton in the own data center, but it can be started with a dataCenter parameter in the ClusterSingletonProxySettings to define that it should route messages to a singleton located in another data center.

This is because the region/coordinator is only aware of its own data center and will activate the entity there. It’s unaware of the existence of corresponding entities in the other data centers.\nEspecially when used together with Pekko Persistence that is based on the single-writer principle it is important to avoid running the same entity at multiple locations at the same time with a shared data store. That would result in corrupt data since the events stored by different instances may be interleaved and would be interpreted differently in a later replay. For replicated persistent entities see Replicated Event Sourcing.\nIf you need global entities you have to pick one data center to host that entity type and only start ClusterSharding on nodes of that data center. If the data center is unreachable from another data center the entities are inaccessible, which is a reasonable trade-off when selecting consistency over availability.\nThe Cluster Sharding proxy is by default routing messages to the shard regions in their own data center, but it can be started with a data-center parameter to define that it should route messages to a shard region located in another data center.

For example, the routing function could be that odd entity ids are routed to data center A and even entity ids to data center B. Before sending the message to the local region actor you make the decision of which data center it should be routed to. Messages for another data center can be sent with a sharding proxy as explained above and messages for the own data center are sent to the local region.","title":"Cluster Sharding"},{"location":"/typed/distributed-pub-sub.html","text":"","title":"Distributed Publish Subscribe in Cluster"},{"location":"/typed/distributed-pub-sub.html#distributed-publish-subscribe-in-cluster","text":"You are viewing the documentation for the new actor APIs, to view the Pekko Classic documentation, see Classic Distributed Publish Subscribe.","title":"Distributed Publish Subscribe in Cluster"},{"location":"/typed/distributed-pub-sub.html#module-info","text":"The distributed publish subscribe topic API is available and usable with the core (/actor-typed module, however it will only be distributed when used in a clustered application:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"(/cluster-typed\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>(/bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>(/cluster-typed_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:(/bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:(/cluster-typed_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Module info"},{"location":"/typed/distributed-pub-sub.html#the-topic-actor","text":"Distributed publish subscribe is achieved by representing each pub sub topic with an actor, actor.typed.pubsub.Topicactor.typed.pubsub.Topic.\nThe topic actor needs to run on each node where subscribers will live or that wants to publish messages to the topic.\nThe identity of the topic is a tuple of the type of messages that can be published and a string topic name but it is recommended to not define multiple topics with different types and the same topic name.\nScala @@snip [PubSubExample.scala](/(/actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/org/apache/pekko/typed/pubsub/PubSubExample.scala) { #start-topic } Java @@snip [PubSubExample.java](/(/actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/org/apache/pekko/typed/pubsub/PubSubExample.java) { #start-topic }\nLocal actors can then subscribe to the topic (and unsubscribe from it):\nScala @@snip [PubSubExample.scala](/(/actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/org/apache/pekko/typed/pubsub/PubSubExample.scala) { #subscribe } Java @@snip [PubSubExample.java](/(/actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/org/apache/pekko/typed/pubsub/PubSubExample.java) { #subscribe }\nAnd publish messages to the topic:\nScala @@snip [PubSubExample.scala](/(/actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/org/apache/pekko/typed/pubsub/PubSubExample.scala) { #publish } Java @@snip [PubSubExample.java](/(/actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/org/apache/pekko/typed/pubsub/PubSubExample.java) { #publish }","title":"The Topic Actor"},{"location":"/typed/distributed-pub-sub.html#pub-sub-scalability","text":"Each topic is represented by one Receptionist service key meaning that the number of topics will scale to thousands or tens of thousands but for higher numbers of topics will require custom solutions.

That should be rare, but still possible.\nFor interactions between some actors, that is not acceptable and at-least-once delivery or effectively-once processing is needed. The tools for reliable delivery described here help with implementing that. It can’t be achieved automatically under the hood without collaboration from the application. This is because confirming when a message has been fully processed is a business level concern. Only ensuring that it was transferred over the network or delivered to the mailbox of the actor would not be enough, since the actor may crash right before being able to process the message.\nLost messages are detected, resent and deduplicated as needed. In addition, it also includes flow control for the sending of messages to avoid that a fast producer overwhelms a slower consumer or sends messages at a higher rate than what can be transferred over the network. This can be a common problem in interactions between actors, resulting in fatal errors like OutOfMemoryError because too many messages are queued in the mailboxes of the actors. The detection of lost messages and the flow control is driven by the consumer side, which means that the producer side will not send faster than the demand requested by the consumer side. The producer side will not push resends unless requested by the consumer side.\nThere are 3 supported patterns, which are described in the following sections:\nPoint-to-point Work pulling Sharding\nThe Point-to-Point pattern has support for automatically splitting up large messages and assemble them again on the consumer side.

Thereafter the producer will receive a new RequestNext when it’s allowed to send one more message.\nThe producer and ProducerController actors are required to be local so that message delivery is both fast and guaranteed. This requirement is enforced by a runtime check.\nSimilarly, on the consumer side the destination consumer actor will start the flow by sending an initial ConsumerController.Start message to the ConsumerController.\nFor the ProducerController to know where to send the messages, it must be connected with the ConsumerController. This can be done with the ProducerController.RegisterConsumer or ConsumerController.RegisterToProducerController messages. When using the point-to-point pattern, it is the application’s responsibility to connect them together. For example, this can be done by sending the ActorRef in an ordinary message to the other side, or by registering the ActorRef in the Receptionist so it can be found on the other side.\nYou must also take measures to reconnect them if any of the sides crashes, for example by watching it for termination.\nMessages sent by the producer are wrapped in ConsumerController.Delivery when received by a consumer and the consumer should reply with ConsumerController.Confirmed when it has processed the message.\nThe next message is not delivered until the previous one is confirmed. Any messages from the producer that arrive while waiting for the confirmation are stashed by the ConsumerController and delivered when the previous message is confirmed.\nSimilar to the producer side, the consumer and the ConsumerController actors are required to be local so that message delivery is both fast and guaranteed. This requirement is enforced by a runtime check.\nMany unconfirmed messages can be in flight between the ProducerController and ConsumerController, but their number is limited by a flow control window. The flow control is driven by the consumer side, which means that the ProducerController will not send faster than the demand requested by the ConsumerController.","title":"Point-to-point"},{"location":"/typed/reliable-delivery.html#point-to-point-example","text":"An example of a fibonacci number generator (producer):\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.typed.ActorRef\nimport pekko.actor.typed.Behavior\nimport pekko.actor.typed.delivery.ProducerController\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors\n\nobject FibonacciProducer {\n  sealed trait Command\n\n  private case class WrappedRequestNext(r: ProducerController.RequestNext[FibonacciConsumer.Command]) extends Command\n\n  def apply(\n      producerController: ActorRef[ProducerController.Command[FibonacciConsumer.Command]]): Behavior[Command] = {\n    Behaviors.setup { context =>\n      val requestNextAdapter =\n        context.messageAdapter[ProducerController.RequestNext[FibonacciConsumer.Command]](WrappedRequestNext(_))\n      producerController !

No explicit registration is needed between the ShardingConsumerController and ShardingProducerController.\nThe producer actor will start the flow by sending a ShardingProducerController.Start message to the ShardingProducerController.\nThe ShardingProducerController sends RequestNext to the producer, which is then allowed to send one message to the ShardingProducerController. Thereafter the producer will receive a new RequestNext when it’s allowed to send one more message.\nIn the ShardingProducerController.RequestNextShardingProducerController.RequestNext message there is information about which entities that have demand. It is allowed to send to a new entityId that is not included in the RequestNext.entitiesWithDemand. If sending to an entity that doesn’t have demand the message will be buffered. This support for buffering means that it is even allowed to send several messages in response to one RequestNext but it’s recommended to only send one message and wait for next RequestNext before sending more messages.\nThe producer and ShardingProducerController actors are supposed to be local so that these messages are fast and not lost. This is enforced by a runtime check.\nSimilarly, on the consumer side the destination consumer actor will start the flow by sending an initial ConsumerController.Start message to the ConsumerController.\nThere will be one ShardingConsumerController for each entity. Many unconfirmed messages can be in flight between the ShardingProducerController and each ShardingConsumerController, but it is limited by a flow control window. The flow control is driven by the consumer side, which means that the ShardingProducerController will not send faster than the demand requested by the consumers.","title":"Sharding"},{"location":"/typed/reliable-delivery.html#sharding-example","text":"The sharded entity is a todo list which uses an async database call to store its entire state on each change, and first when that completes replies to reliable delivery that the message was consumed.\nExample of TodoList entity (consumer):\nScala copysourceimport scala.concurrent.Future\nimport scala.concurrent.duration._\nimport scala.util.Failure\nimport scala.util.Success\n\nimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.Done\nimport pekko.actor.typed.ActorRef\nimport pekko.actor.typed.Behavior\nimport pekko.actor.typed.delivery.ConsumerController\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.ActorContext\nimport pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors\nimport pekko.cluster.sharding.typed.delivery.ShardingConsumerController\nimport pekko.util.Timeout\n\ntrait DB {\n  def save(id: String, value: TodoList.State): Future[Done]\n  def load(id: String): Future[TodoList.State]\n}\n\nobject TodoList {\n\n  sealed trait Command\n\n  final case class AddTask(item: String) extends Command\n  final case class CompleteTask(item: String) extends Command\n\n  private final case class InitialState(state: State) extends Command\n  private final case class SaveSuccess(confirmTo: ActorRef[ConsumerController.Confirmed]) extends Command\n  private final case class DBError(cause: Throwable) extends Command\n\n  private final case class CommandDelivery(command: Command, confirmTo: ActorRef[ConsumerController.Confirmed])\n      extends Command\n\n  final case class State(tasks: Vector[String])\n\n  def apply(\n      id: String,\n      db: DB,\n      consumerController: ActorRef[ConsumerController.Start[Command]]): Behavior[Command] = {\n    Behaviors.setup[Command] { context =>\n      new TodoList(context, id, db).start(consumerController)\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\nclass TodoList(context: ActorContext[TodoList.Command], id: String, db: DB) {\n  import TodoList._\n\n  private def start(consumerController: ActorRef[ConsumerController.Start[Command]]): Behavior[Command] = {\n    context.pipeToSelf(db.load(id)) {\n      case Success(value) => InitialState(value)\n      case Failure(cause) => DBError(cause)\n    }\n\n    Behaviors.receiveMessagePartial {\n      case InitialState(state) =>\n        val deliveryAdapter: ActorRef[ConsumerController.Delivery[Command]] = context.messageAdapter { delivery =>\n          CommandDelivery(delivery.message, delivery.confirmTo)\n        }\n        consumerController !

This is especially useful for Persistence.\nThe manifest string can also encode a version number that can be used in fromBinaryfromBinaryJava to deserialize in different ways to migrate old data to new domain objects.\nIf the data was originally serialized with Serializer and in a later version of the system you change to SerializerWithStringManifest then the manifest string will be the full class name if you used includeManifest=true, otherwise it will be the empty string.\nThis is how a SerializerWithStringManifest looks like:\nScala copysourceclass MyOwnSerializer2 extends SerializerWithStringManifest {\n\n  val CustomerManifest = \"customer\"\n  val UserManifest = \"user\"\n  val UTF_8 = StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name()\n\n  // Pick a unique identifier for your Serializer,\n  // you've got a couple of billions to choose from,\n  // 0 - 40 is reserved by Pekko itself\n  def identifier = 1234567\n\n  // The manifest (type hint) that will be provided in the fromBinary method\n  // Use `\"\"` if manifest is not needed.\n  def manifest(obj: AnyRef): String =\n    obj match {\n      case _: Customer => CustomerManifest\n      case _: User     => UserManifest\n    }\n\n  // \"toBinary\" serializes the given object to an Array of Bytes\n  def toBinary(obj: AnyRef): Array[Byte] = {\n    // Put the real code that serializes the object here\n    obj match {\n      case Customer(name) => name.getBytes(UTF_8)\n      case User(name)     => name.getBytes(UTF_8)\n    }\n  }\n\n  // \"fromBinary\" deserializes the given array,\n  // using the type hint\n  def fromBinary(bytes: Array[Byte], manifest: String): AnyRef = {\n    // Put the real code that deserializes here\n    manifest match {\n      case CustomerManifest =>\n        Customer(new String(bytes, UTF_8))\n      case UserManifest =>\n        User(new String(bytes, UTF_8))\n    }\n  }\n} Java copysourcestatic class MyOwnSerializer2 extends SerializerWithStringManifest {\n\n  private static final String CUSTOMER_MANIFEST = \"customer\";\n  private static final String USER_MANIFEST = \"user\";\n  private static final Charset UTF_8 = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;\n\n  // Pick a unique identifier for your Serializer,\n  // you've got a couple of billions to choose from,\n  // 0 - 40 is reserved by Pekko itself\n  @Override\n  public int identifier() {\n    return 1234567;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String manifest(Object obj) {\n    if (obj instanceof Customer) return CUSTOMER_MANIFEST;\n    else if (obj instanceof User) return USER_MANIFEST;\n    else throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown type: \" + obj);\n  }\n\n  // \"toBinary\" serializes the given object to an Array of Bytes\n  @Override\n  public byte[] toBinary(Object obj) {\n    // Put the real code that serializes the object here\n    if (obj instanceof Customer) return ((Customer) obj).name.getBytes(UTF_8);\n    else if (obj instanceof User) return ((User) obj).name.getBytes(UTF_8);\n    else throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown type: \" + obj);\n  }\n\n  // \"fromBinary\" deserializes the given array,\n  // using the type hint\n  @Override\n  public Object fromBinary(byte[] bytes, String manifest) {\n    // Put the real code that deserializes here\n    if (manifest.equals(CUSTOMER_MANIFEST)) return new Customer(new String(bytes, UTF_8));\n    else if (manifest.equals(USER_MANIFEST)) return new User(new String(bytes, UTF_8));\n    else throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown manifest: \" + manifest);\n  }\n}\nYou must also bind it to a name in your configuration and then list which classes should be serialized by it.\nIt’s recommended to throw IllegalArgumentException or NotSerializableException in fromBinary if the manifest is unknown. This makes it possible to introduce new message types and send them to nodes that don’t know about them. This is typically needed when performing rolling updates, i.e. running a cluster with mixed versions for a while. Those exceptions are treated as a transient problem in the classic remoting layer. The problem will be logged and the message dropped. Other exceptions will tear down the TCP connection because it can be an indication of corrupt bytes from the underlying transport. Artery TCP handles all deserialization exceptions as transient problems.","title":"Serializer with String Manifest"},{"location":"/serialization.html#serializing-actorrefs","text":"Actor references are typically included in the messages.

The manifest is only used within the SerializerJSerializer to decide how to deserialize the payload, so one SerializerJSerializer can handle many classes.\nThat means that it is possible to change serialization for a message by performing two rolling update steps to switch to the new serializer.\nAdd the SerializerJSerializer class and define it in pekko.actor.serializers config section, but not in pekko.actor.serialization-bindings. Perform a rolling update for this change. This means that the serializer class exists on all nodes and is registered, but it is still not used for serializing any messages. That is important because during the rolling update the old nodes still don’t know about the new serializer and would not be able to deserialize messages with that format.

In this example Animal is used inside of Zoo, which is sent as a message or persisted. If Animal was sent or persisted standalone the annotations are not needed because then it is the concrete subclasses Lion or Elephant that are serialized.\nWhen specifying allowed subclasses with those annotations the class names will not be included in the serialized representation and that is important for preventing loading of malicious serialization gadgets when deserializing.\nWarning Don’t use @JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS) or ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping since that is a security risk when using polymorphic types.\nADT with trait and case object It’s common in Scala to use a sealed trait and case objects to represent enums. If the values are case classes the @JsonSubTypes annotation as described above works, but if the values are case objects it will not. The annotation requires a Class and there is no way to define that in an annotation for a case object. The easiest workaround is to define the case objects as case class without any field. Alternatively, you can define an intermediate trait for the case object and a custom deserializer for it. The example below builds on the previous Animal sample by adding a fictitious, single instance, new animal, an Unicorn. Scala copysourcefinal case class Zoo(primaryAttraction: Animal) extends MySerializable\n\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, property = \"type\")\n@JsonSubTypes(\n  Array(\n    new JsonSubTypes.Type(value = classOf[Lion], name = \"lion\"),\n    new JsonSubTypes.Type(value = classOf[Elephant], name = \"elephant\"),\n    new JsonSubTypes.Type(value = classOf[Unicorn], name = \"unicorn\")))\nsealed trait Animal\n\nfinal case class Lion(name: String) extends Animal\nfinal case class Elephant(name: String, age: Int) extends Animal\n\n@JsonDeserialize(`using` = classOf[UnicornDeserializer])\nsealed trait Unicorn extends Animal\n@JsonTypeName(\"unicorn\")\ncase object Unicorn extends Unicorn\n\nclass UnicornDeserializer extends StdDeserializer[Unicorn](Unicorn.getClass) {\n  // whenever we need to deserialize an instance of Unicorn trait, we return the object Unicorn\n  override def deserialize(p: JsonParser, ctxt: DeserializationContext): Unicorn = Unicorn\n} The case object Unicorn can’t be used in a @JsonSubTypes annotation, but its trait can. When serializing the case object we need to know which type tag to use, hence the @JsonTypeName annotation on the object. When deserializing, Jackson will only know about the trait variant therefore we need a custom deserializer that returns the case object. On the other hand, if the ADT only has case objects, you can solve it by implementing a custom serialization for the enums. Annotate the trait with @JsonSerialize and @JsonDeserialize and implement the serialization with StdSerializer and StdDeserializer.

This service degradation is usually fine since the rolling update will eventually complete and all old processes will be replaced with the new binary. To avoid this service degradation you can also use forward-one support in your schema evolutions.\nTo complete a no-degradation rolling update, you need to make two deployments. First, deploy a new binary which can read the new schema but still uses the old schema. Then, deploy a second binary which serializes data using the new schema and drops the downcasting code from the migration.\nLet’s take, for example, the case above where we renamed a field.\nThe starting schema is:\nScala copysourcecase class ItemAdded(shoppingCartId: String, productId: String, quantity: Int) extends MySerializable Java copysourcepublic class ItemAdded implements MySerializable {\n  public final String shoppingCartId;\n  public final String productId;\n  public final int quantity;\n\n  public ItemAdded(String shoppingCartId, String productId, int quantity) {\n    this.shoppingCartId = shoppingCartId;\n    this.productId = productId;\n    this.quantity = quantity;\n  }\n}\nIn a first deployment, we still don’t make any change to the event class:\nScala copysourcecase class ItemAdded(shoppingCartId: String, productId: String, quantity: Int) extends MySerializable Java copysourcepublic class ItemAdded implements MySerializable {\n  public final String shoppingCartId;\n  public final String productId;\n  public final int quantity;\n\n  public ItemAdded(String shoppingCartId, String productId, int quantity) {\n    this.shoppingCartId = shoppingCartId;\n    this.productId = productId;\n    this.quantity = quantity;\n  }\n}\nbut we introduce a migration that can read the newer schema which is versioned 2:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.serialization.jackson.JacksonMigration\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode\n\nclass ItemAddedMigration extends JacksonMigration {\n\n  // Data produced in this node is still produced using the version 1 of the schema\n  override def currentVersion: Int = 1\n\n  override def supportedForwardVersion: Int = 2\n\n  override def transform(fromVersion: Int, json: JsonNode): JsonNode = {\n    val root = json.asInstanceOf[ObjectNode]\n    if (fromVersion == 2) {\n      // When receiving an event of version 2 we down-cast it to the version 1 of the schema\n      root.set[JsonNode](\"productId\", root.get(\"itemId\"))\n      root.remove(\"itemId\")\n    }\n    root\n  }\n} Java copysource import org.apache.pekko.serialization.jackson.JacksonMigration;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode;\n\npublic class ItemAddedMigration extends JacksonMigration {\n\n  // Data produced in this node is still produced using the version 1 of the schema\n  @Override\n  public int currentVersion() {\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int supportedForwardVersion() {\n    return 2;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public JsonNode transform(int fromVersion, JsonNode json) {\n    ObjectNode root = (ObjectNode) json;\n    if (fromVersion == 2) {\n      // When receiving an event of version 2 we down-cast it to the version 1 of the schema\n      root.set(\"productId\", root.get(\"itemId\"));\n      root.remove(\"itemId\");\n    }\n    return root;\n  }\n}\nOnce all running nodes have the new migration code which can read version 2 of ItemAdded we can proceed with the second step.

By enabling remoting the system will start listening on a provided network address and also gains the ability to connect to other systems through the network. From the application’s perspective there is no API difference between local or remote systems, ActorRefActorRef instances that point to remote systems look exactly the same as local ones: they can be sent messages to, watched, etc. Every ActorRef contains hostname and port information and can be passed around even on the network. This means that on a network every ActorRef is a unique identifier of an actor on that network.\nYou need to enable serialization for your actor messages. Serialization with Jackson is a good choice in many cases and our recommendation if you don’t have other preference.\nRemoting is not a server-client technology. All systems using remoting can contact any other system on the network if they possess an ActorRef pointing to those system.

It uses more CPU than TCP when the system is idle or at low message rates. There is no encryption for Aeron.\nThe TCP and TLS transport is implemented using Pekko Streams TCP/TLS. This is the choice when encryption is needed, but it can also be used with plain TCP without TLS. It’s also the obvious choice when UDP can’t be used. It has very good performance (high throughput and low latency) but latency at high throughput might not be as good as the Aeron transport. It has less operational complexity than the Aeron transport and less risk of trouble in container environments.\nAeron requires 64bit JVM to work reliably and is only officially supported on Linux, Mac and Windows. It may work on other Unixes e.g. Solaris but insufficient testing has taken place for it to be officially supported.

This address is part of the unique name of the system and will be used by other systems to open a connection to it and send messages. This means that if a host has multiple names (different DNS records pointing to the same IP address) then only one of these can be canonical. If a message arrives to a system but it contains a different hostname than the expected canonical name then the message will be dropped. If multiple names for a system would be allowed, then equality checks among ActorRefActorRef instances would no longer to be trusted and this would violate the fundamental assumption that an actor has a globally unique reference on a given network. As a consequence, this also means that localhost addresses (e.g. 127.0.0.1) cannot be used in general (apart from local development) since they are not unique addresses in a real network.\nIn cases, where Network Address Translation (NAT) is used or other network bridging is involved, it is important to configure the system so that it understands that there is a difference between his externally visible, canonical address and between the host-port pair that is used to listen for connections.

These methods are available even in remoting enabled systems:\nRemote Lookup : used to look up an actor on a remote node with actorSelection(path)actorSelection(path) Remote Creation : used to create an actor on a remote node with actorOf(Props(...), actorName)actorOf(Props(...), actorName)\nIn the next sections the two alternatives are described in detail.","title":"Acquiring references to remote actors"},{"location":"/remoting-artery.html#looking-up-remote-actors","text":"actorSelection(path)actorSelection(path) will obtain an ActorSelectionActorSelection to an Actor on a remote node, e.g.:\nScala val selection =\n  context.actorSelection(\"pekko://actorSystemName@10.0.0.1:25520/user/actorName\")\n Java ActorSelection selection =\n  context.actorSelection(\"pekko://actorSystemName@10.0.0.1:25520/user/actorName\");\nAs you can see from the example above the following pattern is used to find an actor on a remote node:\npekko://<actor system>@<hostname>:<port>/<actor path>\nNote Unlike with earlier remoting, the protocol field is always pekko as pluggable transports are no longer supported.\nOnce you obtained a selection to the actor you can interact with it in the same way you would with a local actor, e.g.:\nScala selection ! \"Pretty awesome feature\"\n Java selection.tell(\"Pretty awesome feature\", getSelf());\nTo acquire an ActorRefActorRef for an ActorSelectionActorSelection you need to send a message to the selection and use the sender()getSender() reference of the reply from the actor. There is a built-in IdentifyIdentify message that all Actors will understand and automatically reply to with a ActorIdentityActorIdentity message containing the ActorRef.

Please consult those resources when troubleshooting and configuring SSL.\nMutual authentication between TLS peers is enabled by default. Mutual authentication means that the passive side (the TLS server side) of a connection will also request and verify a certificate from the connecting peer. Without this mode only the client side is requesting and verifying certificates. While Pekko is a peer-to-peer technology, each connection between nodes starts out from one side (the “client”) towards the other (the “server”).\nNote that if TLS is enabled with mutual authentication there is still a risk that an attacker can gain access to a valid certificate by compromising any node with certificates issued by the same internal PKI tree.\nIt’s recommended that you enable hostname verification with pekko.remote.artery.ssl.config-ssl-engine.hostname-verification=on. When enabled it will verify that the destination hostname matches the hostname in the peer’s certificate.\nIn deployments where hostnames are dynamic and not known up front it can make sense to leave the hostname verification off.\nYou have a few choices how to set up certificates and hostname verification:\nHave a single set of keys and a single certificate for all nodes and disable hostname checking The single set of keys and the single certificate is distributed to all nodes. The certificate can be self-signed as it is distributed both as a certificate for authentication but also as the trusted certificate. If the keys/certificate are lost, someone else can connect to your cluster. Adding nodes to the cluster is simple as the key material can be deployed / distributed to the new node. Have a single set of keys and a single certificate for all nodes that contains all of the host names and enable hostname checking. This means that only the hosts mentioned in the certificate can connect to the cluster. It cannot be checked, though, if the node you talk to is actually the node it is supposed to be (or if it is one of the other nodes). This seems like a minor restriction as you’ll have to trust all cluster nodes the same in an Pekko cluster anyway. The certificate can be self-signed in which case the same single certificate is distributed and trusted on all nodes (but see the next bullet) Adding a new node means that its host name needs to conform to the trusted host names in the certificate. That either means to foresee new hosts, use a wildcard certificate, or use a full CA in the first place, so you can later issue more certificates if more nodes are to be added (but then you already get into the territory of the next solution). If a certificate is stolen, it can only be used to connect to the cluster from a node reachable via a hostname that is trusted in the certificate. It would require tampering with DNS to allow other nodes to get access to the cluster (however, tampering DNS might be easier in an internal setting than on internet scale). Have a CA and then keys/certificates, one for each node, and enable host name checking. Basically like internet HTTPS but that you only trust the internal CA and then issue certificates for each new node. Needs a PKI, the CA certificate is trusted on all nodes, the individual certificates are used for authentication. Only the CA certificate and the key/certificate for a node is distributed. If keys/certificates are stolen, only the same node can access the cluster (unless DNS is tampered with as well). You can revoke single certificates.\nSee also a description of the settings in the Remote Configuration section.\nNote When using SHA1PRNG on Linux it’s recommended specify -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom as argument to the JVM to prevent blocking.

Should a client send them nonetheless they are dropped and logged (at DEBUG level in order to reduce the possibilities for a denial of service attack). PossiblyHarmful covers the predefined messages like PoisonPillPoisonPill and KillKill, but it can also be added as a marker trait to user-defined messages.\nWarning Untrusted mode does not give full protection against attacks by itself. It makes it slightly harder to perform malicious or unintended actions but it should be noted that Java serialization should still not be enabled. Additional protection can be achieved when running in an untrusted network by network security (e.g. firewalls) and/or enabling TLS with mutual authentication.\nMessages sent with actor selection are by default discarded in untrusted mode, but permission to receive actor selection messages can be granted to specific actors defined in configuration:\npekko.remote.artery.trusted-selection-paths = [\"/user/receptionist\", \"/user/namingService\"]\nThe actual message must still not be of type PossiblyHarmful.\nIn summary, the following operations are ignored by a system configured in untrusted mode when incoming via the remoting layer:\nremote deployment (which also means no remote supervision) remote DeathWatch system.stop()system.stop(), PoisonPillPoisonPill, KillKill sending any message which extends from the PossiblyHarmfulPossiblyHarmful marker interface, which includes TerminatedTerminated messages sent with actor selection, unless destination defined in trusted-selection-paths.\nNote Enabling the untrusted mode does not remove the capability of the client to freely choose the target of its message sends, which means that messages not prohibited by the above rules can be sent to any actor in the remote system. It is good practice for a client-facing system to only contain a well-defined set of entry point actors, which then forward requests (possibly after performing validation) to another actor system containing the actual worker actors.

Aeron is using UDP and adds among other things reliable delivery and session semantics, very similar to TCP. This means that the order of the messages are preserved, which is needed for the Actor message ordering guarantees. Under normal circumstances all messages will be delivered but there are cases when messages may not be delivered to the destination:\nduring a network partition when the TCP connection or the Aeron session is broken, this automatically recovered once the partition is over when sending too many messages without flow control and thereby filling up the outbound send queue (outbound-message-queue-size config) if serialization or deserialization of a message fails (only that message will be dropped) if an unexpected exception occurs in the remoting infrastructure\nIn short, Actor message delivery is “at-most-once” as described in Message Delivery Reliability\nSome messages in Pekko are called system messages and those cannot be dropped because that would result in an inconsistent state between the systems. Such messages are used for essentially two features; remote death watch and remote deployment. These messages are delivered by Pekko remoting with “exactly-once” guarantee by confirming each message and resending unconfirmed messages. If a system message anyway cannot be delivered the association with the destination system is irrecoverable failed, and Terminated is signaled for all watched actors on the remote system. It is placed in a so called quarantined state. Quarantine usually does not happen if remote watch or remote deployment is not used.\nEach ActorSystemActorSystem instance has an unique identifier (UID), which is important for differentiating between incarnations of a system when it is restarted with the same hostname and port. It is the specific incarnation (UID) that is quarantined. The only way to recover from this state is to restart one of the actor systems.\nMessages that are sent to and received from a quarantined system will be dropped. However, it is possible to send messages with actorSelection to the address of a quarantined system, which is useful to probe if the system has been restarted.\nAn association will be quarantined when:\nCluster node is removed from the cluster membership. Remote failure detector triggers, i.e. remote watch is used. This is different when Pekko Cluster is used. The unreachable observation by the cluster failure detector can go back to reachable if the network partition heals. A cluster member is not quarantined when the failure detector triggers. Overflow of the system message delivery buffer, e.g. because of too many watch requests at the same time (system-message-buffer-size config). Unexpected exception occurs in the control subchannel of the remoting infrastructure.\nThe UID of the ActorSystemActorSystem is exchanged in a two-way handshake when the first message is sent to a destination. The handshake will be retried until the other system replies and no other messages will pass through until the handshake is completed. If the handshake cannot be established within a timeout (handshake-timeout config) the association is stopped (freeing up resources). Queued messages will be dropped if the handshake cannot be established. It will not be quarantined, because the UID is unknown.

The basic idea of the phi failure detector is to express the value of phi on a scale that is dynamically adjusted to reflect current network conditions.\nThe value of phi is calculated as:\nphi = -log10(1 - F(timeSinceLastHeartbeat))\nwhere F is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation estimated from historical heartbeat inter-arrival times.\nIn the Remote Configuration you can adjust the pekko.remote.watch-failure-detector.threshold to define when a phi value is considered to be a failure.\nA low threshold is prone to generate many false positives but ensures a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high threshold generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes. The default threshold is 10 and is appropriate for most situations. However in cloud environments, such as Amazon EC2, the value could be increased to 12 in order to account for network issues that sometimes occur on such platforms.\nThe following chart illustrates how phi increase with increasing time since the previous heartbeat.\nPhi is calculated from the mean and standard deviation of historical inter arrival times.

While this provides good isolation for Pekko services, all user communications by default happen through a shared network connection. When some actors send large messages this can cause other messages to suffer higher latency as they need to wait until the full message has been transported on the shared channel (and hence, shared bottleneck). In these cases it is usually helpful to separate actors that have different QoS requirements: large messages vs. low latency.\nPekko remoting provides a dedicated channel for large messages if configured. Since actor message ordering must not be violated the channel is actually dedicated for actors instead of messages, to ensure all of the messages arrive in send order. It is possible to assign actors on given paths to use this dedicated channel by using path patterns that have to be specified in the actor system’s configuration on both the sending and the receiving side:\npekko.remote.artery.large-message-destinations = [\n   \"/user/largeMessageActor\",\n   \"/user/largeMessagesGroup/*\",\n   \"/user/anotherGroup/*/largeMesssages\",\n   \"/user/thirdGroup/**\",\n   \"/temp/session-ask-actor*\"\n]\n*NOTE: Support for * inside of an actor path (ie. /temp/session-ask-actor*) is only available in 2.6.18+\nThis means that all messages sent to the following actors will pass through the dedicated, large messages channel:\n/user/largeMessageActor /user/largeMessageActorGroup/actor1 /user/largeMessageActorGroup/actor2 /user/anotherGroup/actor1/largeMessages /user/anotherGroup/actor2/largeMessages /user/thirdGroup/actor3/ /user/thirdGroup/actor4/actor5 /temp/session-ask-actor$abc\nMessages destined for actors not matching any of these patterns are sent using the default channel as before.\nTo notice large messages you can enable logging of message types with payload size in bytes larger than the configured log-frame-size-exceeding.\npekko.remote.artery {\n  log-frame-size-exceeding = 10000b\n}\nExample log messages:\n[INFO] Payload size for [java.lang.String] is [39068] bytes.

If you run more than one Pekko application JVM on the same machine it can therefore be wise to share the media driver by running it as a separate process.\nThe media driver has also different resource usage characteristics than a normal application and it can therefore be more efficient and stable to run the media driver as a separate process.\nGiven that Aeron jar files are in the classpath the standalone media driver can be started with:\njava io.aeron.driver.MediaDriver\nThe needed classpath:\nAgrona-0.5.4.jar:aeron-driver-1.0.1.jar:aeron-client-1.0.1.jar\nYou find those jar files on Maven Central, or you can create a package with your preferred build tool.\nYou can pass Aeron properties as command line -D system properties:\n-Daeron.dir=/dev/shm/aeron\nYou can also define Aeron properties in a file:\njava io.aeron.driver.MediaDriver config/aeron.properties\nAn example of such a properties file:\naeron.mtu.length=16384\naeron.socket.so_sndbuf=2097152\naeron.socket.so_rcvbuf=2097152\naeron.rcv.buffer.length=16384\naeron.rcv.initial.window.length=2097152\nagrona.disable.bounds.checks=true\n\naeron.threading.mode=SHARED_NETWORK\n\n# low latency settings\n#aeron.threading.mode=DEDICATED\n#aeron.sender.idle.strategy=org.agrona.concurrent.BusySpinIdleStrategy\n#aeron.receiver.idle.strategy=org.agrona.concurrent.BusySpinIdleStrategy\n\n# use same director in pekko.remote.artery.advanced.aeron-dir config\n# of the Pekko application\naeron.dir=/dev/shm/aeron\nRead more about the media driver in the Aeron documentation.\nTo use the external media driver from the Pekko application you need to define the following two configuration properties:\npekko.remote.artery.advanced.aeron {\n  embedded-media-driver = off\n  aeron-dir = /dev/shm/aeron\n}\nThe aeron-dir must match the directory you started the media driver with, i.e. the aeron.dir property.\nSeveral Pekko applications can then be configured to use the same media driver by pointing to the same directory.\nNote that if the media driver process is stopped the Pekko applications that are using it will also be stopped.","title":"External, shared Aeron media driver"},{"location":"/remoting-artery.html#aeron-tuning","text":"See Aeron documentation about Performance Testing.","title":"Aeron Tuning"},{"location":"/remoting-artery.html#fine-tuning-cpu-usage-latency-tradeoff","text":"Artery has been designed for low latency and as a result it can be CPU hungry when the system is mostly idle.

There is a built-in Identify message that all Actors will understand and automatically reply to with a ActorIdentity message containing the ActorRef. This can also be done with the resolveOne method of the ActorSelection, which returns a FutureCompletionStage of the matching ActorRef.\nNote For more details on how actor addresses and paths are formed and used, please refer to Actor References, Paths and Addresses.\nNote Message sends to actors that are actually in the sending actor system do not get delivered via the remote actor ref provider. They’re delivered directly, by the local actor ref provider. Aside from providing better performance, this also means that if the hostname you configure remoting to listen as cannot actually be resolved from within the very same actor system, such messages will (perhaps counterintuitively) be delivered just fine.","title":"Looking up Remote Actors"},{"location":"/remoting.html#creating-actors-remotely","text":"If you want to use the creation functionality in Pekko remoting you have to further amend the application.conf file in the following way (only showing deployment section):\npekko {\n  actor {\n    deployment {\n      /sampleActor {\n        remote = \"pekko.tcp://sampleActorSystem@127.0.0.1:2553\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe configuration above instructs Pekko to react when an actor with path /sampleActor is created, i.e. using system.actorOf(Props(...), \"sampleActor\")system.actorOf(new Props(...), \"sampleActor\"). This specific actor will not be directly instantiated, but instead the remote daemon of the remote system will be asked to create the actor, which in this sample corresponds to sampleActorSystem@127.0.0.1:2553.\nOnce you have configured the properties above you would do the following in code:\nScala copysource val actor = system.actorOf(Props[SampleActor](), \"sampleActor\")\nactor ! \"Pretty slick\" Java copysource ActorRef actor = system.actorOf(Props.create(SampleActor.class), \"sampleActor\");\nactor.tell(\"Pretty slick\", ActorRef.noSender());\nThe actor class SampleActor has to be available to the runtimes using it, i.e. the classloader of the actor systems has to have a JAR containing the class.\nWhen using remote deployment of actors you must ensure that all parameters of the Props can be serialized.\nNote In order to ensure serializability of Props when passing constructor arguments to the actor being created, do not make the factory ana non-static inner class: this will inherently capture a reference to its enclosing object, which in most cases is not serializable. It is best to create a factory method in the companion object of the actor’s classmake a static inner class which implements Creator<T extends Actor>. Serializability of all Props can be tested by setting the configuration item pekko.actor.serialize-creators=on. Only Props whose deploy has LocalScope are exempt from this check.\nNote You can use asterisks as wildcard matches for the actor path sections, so you could specify: /*/sampleActor and that would match all sampleActor on that level in the hierarchy. You can also use wildcard in the last position to match all actors at a certain level: /someParent/*. Non-wildcard matches always have higher priority to match than wildcards, so: /foo/bar is considered more specific than /foo/* and only the highest priority match is used.

After a restart communication can be resumed again and the link can become Active again.","title":"Lifecycle and Failure Recovery Model"},{"location":"/remoting.html#watching-remote-actors","text":"Watching a remote actor is not different than watching a local actor, as described in Lifecycle Monitoring aka DeathWatch.","title":"Watching Remote Actors"},{"location":"/remoting.html#failure-detector","text":"Please see:\nPhi Accrual Failure Detector implementation for details Using the Failure Detector below for usage","title":"Failure Detector"},{"location":"/remoting.html#using-the-failure-detector","text":"Remoting uses the org.apache.pekko.remote.PhiAccrualFailureDetector failure detector by default, or you can provide your by implementing the org.apache.pekko.remote.FailureDetector and configuring it:\npekko.remote.watch-failure-detector.implementation-class = \"com.example.CustomFailureDetector\"\nIn the Remote Configuration you may want to adjust these depending on you environment:\nWhen a phi value is considered to be a failure pekko.remote.watch-failure-detector.threshold Margin of error for sudden abnormalities pekko.remote.watch-failure-detector.acceptable-heartbeat-pause","title":"Using the Failure Detector"},{"location":"/remoting.html#serialization","text":"You need to enable serialization for your actor messages.

Temporary and permanent failures are indistinguishable because decisions must be made in finite time, and there always exists a temporary failure that lasts longer than the time limit for the decision.\nA third type of problem is if a process is unresponsive, e.g. because of overload, CPU starvation or long garbage collection pauses. This is also indistinguishable from network partitions and crashes. The only signal we have for decision is “no reply in given time for heartbeats” and this means that phenomena causing delays or lost heartbeats are indistinguishable from each other and must be handled in the same way.\nWhen there is a crash, we would like to remove the affected node immediately from the cluster membership. When there is a network partition or unresponsive process we would like to wait for a while in the hope that it is a transient problem that will heal again, but at some point, we must give up and continue with the nodes on one side of the partition and shut down nodes on the other side. Also, certain features are not fully available during partitions so it might not matter that the partition is transient or not if it just takes too long. Those two goals are in conflict with each other and there is a trade-off between how quickly we can remove a crashed node and premature action on transient network partitions.\nThis is a difficult problem to solve given that the nodes on the different sides of the network partition cannot communicate with each other. We must ensure that both sides can make this decision by themselves and that they take the same decision about which part will keep running and which part will shut itself down.\nAnother type of problem that makes it difficult to see the “right” picture is when some nodes are not fully connected and cannot communicate directly to each other but information can be disseminated between them via other nodes.\nThe Pekko cluster has a failure detector that will notice network partitions and machine crashes (but it cannot distinguish the two). It uses periodic heartbeat messages to check if other nodes are available and healthy. These observations by the failure detector are referred to as a node being unreachable and it may become reachable again if the failure detector observes that it can communicate with it again.\nThe failure detector in itself is not enough for making the right decision in all situations. The naive approach is to remove an unreachable node from the cluster membership after a timeout. This works great for crashes and short transient network partitions, but not for long network partitions. Both sides of the network partition will see the other side as unreachable and after a while remove it from its cluster membership. Since this happens on both sides the result is that two separate disconnected clusters have been created. This approach is provided by the opt-in (off by default) auto-down feature in the OSS version of Pekko Cluster.\nIf you use the timeout based auto-down feature in combination with Cluster Singleton or Cluster Sharding that would mean that two singleton instances or two sharded entities with the same identifier would be running. One would be running: one in each cluster. For example when used together with Pekko Persistence that could result in that two instances of a persistent actor with the same persistenceId are running and writing concurrently to the same stream of persistent events, which will have fatal consequences when replaying these events.\nThe default setting in Pekko Cluster is to not remove unreachable nodes automatically and the recommendation is that the decision of what to do should be taken by a human operator or an external monitoring system. This is a valid solution, but not very convenient if you do not have this staff or external system for other reasons.\nIf the unreachable nodes are not downed at all they will still be part of the cluster membership. Meaning that Cluster Singleton and Cluster Sharding will not failover to another node. While there are unreachable nodes new nodes that are joining the cluster will not be promoted to full worthy members (with status Up). Similarly, leaving members will not be removed until all unreachable nodes have been resolved. In other words, keeping unreachable members for an unbounded time is undesirable.\nWith that introduction of the problem domain, it is time to look at the provided strategies for handling network partition, unresponsive nodes and crashed nodes.","title":"The Problem"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#strategies","text":"By default the Keep Majority strategy will be used because it works well for most systems.

This section describes the different strategies and guidelines of when to use what.\nWhen there is uncertainty it selects to down more nodes than necessary, or even downing of all nodes.

For example, when running Pekko on top of a Spring / Tomcat setup, you could replace the call to System.exit(..) with a call to Spring’s ApplicationContext .close() method (or with a HTTP call to Tomcat Manager’s API to un-deploy the app).","title":"Stable after"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#keep-majority","text":"The strategy named keep-majority will down the unreachable nodes if the current node is in the majority part based on the last known membership information. Otherwise down the reachable nodes, i.e. the own part. If the parts are of equal size the part containing the node with the lowest address is kept.\nThis strategy is a good choice when the number of nodes in the cluster change dynamically and you can therefore not use static-quorum.\nThis strategy also handles the edge case that may occur when there are membership changes at the same time as the network partition occurs. For example, the status of two members are changed to Up on one side but that information is not disseminated to the other side before the connection is broken. Then one side sees two more nodes and both sides might consider themselves having a majority. It will detect this situation and make the safe decision to down all nodes on the side that could be in minority if the joining nodes were changed to Up on the other side. Note that this has the drawback that if the joining nodes were not changed to Up and becoming a majority on the other side then each part will shut down itself, terminating the whole cluster.\nNote that if there are more than two partitions and none is in majority each part will shut down itself, terminating the whole cluster.\nIf more than half of the nodes crash at the same time the other running nodes will down themselves because they think that they are not in majority, and thereby the whole cluster is terminated.\nThe decision can be based on nodes with a configured role instead of all nodes in the cluster. This can be useful when some types of nodes are more valuable than others. You might for example have some nodes responsible for persistent data and some nodes with stateless worker services. Then it probably more important to keep as many persistent data nodes as possible even though it means shutting down more worker nodes.\nConfiguration:\npekko.cluster.split-brain-resolver.active-strategy=keep-majority\ncopysourcepekko.cluster.split-brain-resolver.keep-majority {\n  # if the 'role' is defined the decision is based only on members with that 'role'\n  role = \"\"\n}","title":"Keep Majority"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#static-quorum","text":"The strategy named static-quorum will down the unreachable nodes if the number of remaining nodes are greater than or equal to a configured quorum-size. Otherwise, it will down the reachable nodes, i.e. it will shut down that side of the partition. In other words, the quorum-size defines the minimum number of nodes that the cluster must have to be operational.\nThis strategy is a good choice when you have a fixed number of nodes in the cluster, or when you can define a fixed number of nodes with a certain role.\nFor example, in a 9 node cluster you will configure the quorum-size to 5. If there is a network split of 4 and 5 nodes the side with 5 nodes will survive and the other 4 nodes will be downed. After that, in the 5 node cluster, no more failures can be handled, because the remaining cluster size would be less than 5. In the case of another failure in that 5 node cluster all nodes will be downed.\nTherefore it is important that you join new nodes when old nodes have been removed.\nAnother consequence of this is that if there are unreachable nodes when starting up the cluster, before reaching this limit, the cluster may shut itself down immediately. This is not an issue if you start all nodes at approximately the same time or use the pekko.cluster.min-nr-of-members to define required number of members before the leader changes member status of ‘Joining’ members to ‘Up’ You can tune the timeout after which downing decisions are made using the stable-after setting.\nYou should not add more members to the cluster than quorum-size * 2 - 1. A warning is logged if this recommendation is violated. If the exceeded cluster size remains when a SBR decision is needed it will down all nodes because otherwise there is a risk that both sides may down each other and thereby form two separate clusters.\nFor rolling updates it’s best to leave the cluster gracefully via Coordinated Shutdown (SIGTERM). For successful leaving SBR will not be used (no downing) but if there is an unreachability problem at the same time as the rolling update is in progress there could be an SBR decision. To avoid that the total number of members limit is not exceeded during the rolling update it’s recommended to leave and fully remove one node before adding a new one, when using static-quorum.\nIf the cluster is split into 3 (or more) parts each part that is smaller than then configured quorum-size will down itself and possibly shutdown the whole cluster.\nIf more nodes than the configured quorum-size crash at the same time the other running nodes will down themselves because they think that they are not in the majority, and thereby the whole cluster is terminated.\nThe decision can be based on nodes with a configured role instead of all nodes in the cluster. This can be useful when some types of nodes are more valuable than others. You might, for example, have some nodes responsible for persistent data and some nodes with stateless worker services. Then it probably more important to keep as many persistent data nodes as possible even though it means shutting down more worker nodes.\nThere is another use of the role as well. By defining a role for a few (e.g. 7) stable nodes in the cluster and using that in the configuration of static-quorum you will be able to dynamically add and remove other nodes without this role and still have good decisions of what nodes to keep running and what nodes to shut down in the case of network partitions. The advantage of this approach compared to keep-majority (described below) is that you do not risk splitting the cluster into two separate clusters, i.e. a split brain*. You must still obey the rule of not starting too many nodes with this role as described above. It also suffers the risk of shutting down all nodes if there is a failure when there are not enough nodes with this role remaining in the cluster, as described above.\nConfiguration:\npekko.cluster.split-brain-resolver.active-strategy=static-quorum\ncopysourcepekko.cluster.split-brain-resolver.static-quorum {\n  # minimum number of nodes that the cluster must have\n  quorum-size = undefined\n\n  # if the 'role' is defined the decision is based only on members with that 'role'\n  role = \"\"\n}","title":"Static Quorum"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#keep-oldest","text":"The strategy named keep-oldest will down the part that does not contain the oldest member.

The strategy will not down the single oldest node when it is the only remaining node in the cluster.\nNote that if the oldest node crashes the others will remove it from the cluster when down-if-alone is on, otherwise they will down themselves if the oldest node crashes, i.e. shut down the whole cluster together with the oldest node.\nThis strategy is good to use if you use Cluster Singleton and do not want to shut down the node where the singleton instance runs. If the oldest node crashes a new singleton instance will be started on the next oldest node. The drawback is that the strategy may keep only a few nodes in a large cluster. For example, if one part with the oldest consists of 2 nodes and the other part consists of 98 nodes then it will keep 2 nodes and shut down 98 nodes.\nThis strategy also handles the edge case that may occur when there are membership changes at the same time as the network partition occurs.

It will detect this situation and make the safe decision to down all nodes on the side that sees the oldest as Leaving. Note that this has the drawback that if the oldest was Leaving and not changed to Exiting then each part will shut down itself, terminating the whole cluster.\nThe decision can be based on nodes with a configured role instead of all nodes in the cluster, i.e. using the oldest member (singleton) within the nodes with that role.\nConfiguration:\npekko.cluster.split-brain-resolver.active-strategy=keep-oldest\ncopysourcepekko.cluster.split-brain-resolver.keep-oldest {\n  # Enable downing of the oldest node when it is partitioned from all other nodes\n  down-if-alone = on\n\n  # if the 'role' is defined the decision is based only on members with that 'role',\n  # i.e. using the oldest member (singleton) within the nodes with that role\n  role = \"\"\n}","title":"Keep Oldest"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#down-all","text":"The strategy named down-all will down all nodes.\nThis strategy can be a safe alternative if the network environment is highly unstable with unreachability observations that can’t be fully trusted, and including frequent occurrences of indirectly connected nodes.

In such environments it can be better to shutdown all nodes and start up a new fresh cluster.\nShutting down all nodes means that the system will be completely unavailable until nodes have been restarted and formed a new cluster.

The trade-off compared to other strategies is that it requires additional infrastructure for implementing the lease and it reduces the availability of a decision to that of the system backing the lease store.\nSimilar to other strategies it is important that decisions are not deferred for too long because the nodes that couldn’t acquire the lease must decide to down themselves, see Down all when unstable.\nIn some cases the lease will be unavailable when needed for a decision from all SBR instances, e.g. because it is on another side of a network partition, and then all nodes will be downed.\nConfiguration:\npekko {\n  cluster {\n    downing-provider-class = \"org.apache.pekko.cluster.sbr.SplitBrainResolverProvider\"\n    split-brain-resolver {\n      active-strategy = \"lease-majority\"\n      lease-majority {\n        lease-implementation = \"pekko.coordination.lease.kubernetes\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\ncopysourcepekko.cluster.split-brain-resolver.lease-majority {\n  lease-implementation = \"\"\n\n  # The recommended format for the lease name is \"<service-name>-pekko-sbr\".\n  # When lease-name is not defined, the name will be set to \"<actor-system-name>-pekko-sbr\"\n  lease-name = \"\"\n\n  # This delay is used on the minority side before trying to acquire the lease,\n  # as an best effort to try to keep the majority side.\n  acquire-lease-delay-for-minority = 2s\n\n  # Release the lease after this duration.\n  release-after = 40s\n\n  # If the 'role' is defined the majority/minority is based only on members with that 'role'.\n  role = \"\"\n}\nSee also configuration and additional dependency in Kubernetes Lease","title":"Lease"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#indirectly-connected-nodes","text":"In a malfunctional network there can be situations where nodes are observed as unreachable via some network links but they are still indirectly connected via other nodes, i.e. it’s not a clean network partition (or node crash).\nWhen this situation is detected the Split Brain Resolvers will keep fully connected nodes and down all the indirectly connected nodes.\nIf there is a combination of indirectly connected nodes and a clean network partition it will combine the above decision with the ordinary decision, e.g. keep majority, after excluding suspicious failure detection observations.","title":"Indirectly connected nodes"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#down-all-when-unstable","text":"When reachability observations by the failure detector are changed the SBR decisions are deferred until there are no changes within the stable-after duration.

When such an instance is shut down a new instance is supposed to be started elsewhere in the cluster. It is important that the new instance is not started before the old instance has been stopped. This is especially important when the singleton or the sharded instance is persistent, since there must only be one active writer of the journaled events of a persistent actor instance.\nSince the strategies on different sides of a network partition cannot communicate with each other and they may take the decision at slightly different points in time there must be a time based margin that makes sure that the new instance is not started before the old has been stopped.\nYou would like to configure this to a short duration to have quick failover, but that will increase the risk of having multiple singleton/sharded instances running at the same time and it may take a different amount of time to act on the decision (dissemination of the down/removal). The duration is by default the same as the stable-after property (see Stable after above). It is recommended to leave this value as is, but it can also be separately overriden with the pekko.cluster.down-removal-margin property.\nAnother concern for setting this stable-after/pekko.cluster.down-removal-margin is dealing with JVM pauses e.g. garbage collection. When a node is unresponsive it is not known if it is due to a pause, overload, a crash or a network partition. If it is pause that lasts longer than stable-after * 2 it gives time for SBR to down the node and for singletons and shards to be started on other nodes. When the node un-pauses there will be a short time before it sees its self as down where singletons and sharded actors are still running. It is therefore important to understand the max pause time your application is likely to incur and make sure it is smaller than stable-margin.\nIf you choose to set a separate value for down-removal-margin, the recommended minimum duration for different cluster sizes are:\ncluster size down-removal-margin 5 7 s 10 10 s 20 13 s 50 17 s 100 20 s 1000 30 s","title":"Cluster Singleton and Cluster Sharding"},{"location":"/split-brain-resolver.html#expected-failover-time","text":"As you have seen, there are several configured timeouts that add to the total failover latency.

Reactive Microservices should be isolated, autonomous, and have a single responsibility as identified by Jonas Bonér in the book Reactive Microsystems: The Evolution of Microservices at Scale.\nIn a microservices architecture, you should consider communication within a service and between services.\nIn general we recommend against using Pekko Cluster and actor messaging between different services because that would result in a too tight code coupling between the services and difficulties deploying these independent of each other, which is one of the main reasons for using a microservices architecture. See the discussion on Internal and External Communication for some background on this.\nNodes of a single service (collectively called a cluster) require less decoupling. They share the same code and are deployed together, as a set, by a single team or individual. There might be two versions running concurrently during a rolling deployment, but deployment of the entire set has a single point of control. For this reason, intra-service communication can take advantage of Pekko Cluster, failure management and actor messaging, which is convenient to use and has great performance.\nBetween different services Pekko HTTP or Pekko gRPC can be used for synchronous (yet non-blocking) communication and Pekko Streams Kafka or other Pekko Connectors for integration asynchronous communication. All those communication mechanisms work well with streaming of messages with end-to-end back-pressure, and the synchronous communication tools can also be used for single request response interactions. It is also important to note that when using these tools both sides of the communication do not have to be implemented with Pekko, nor does the programming language matter.","title":"Microservices"},{"location":"/typed/choosing-cluster.html#traditional-distributed-application","text":"We acknowledge that microservices also introduce many new challenges and it’s not the only way to build applications. A traditional distributed application may have less complexity and work well in many cases.

Pekko Cluster can efficiently be used for building such distributed application.\nIn this case, you have a single deployment unit, built from a single code base (or using traditional binary dependency management to modularize) but deployed across many nodes using a single cluster. Tighter coupling is OK, because there is a central point of deployment and control. In some cases, nodes may have specialized runtime roles which means that the cluster is not totally homogenous (e.g., “front-end” and “back-end” nodes, or dedicated master/worker nodes) but if these are run from the same built artifacts this is just a runtime behavior and doesn’t cause the same kind of problems you might get from tight coupling of totally separate artifacts.\nA tightly coupled distributed application has served the industry and many Pekko users well for years and is still a valid choice.","title":"Traditional distributed application"},{"location":"/typed/choosing-cluster.html#distributed-monolith","text":"There is also an anti-pattern that is sometimes called “distributed monolith”.

There is a false sense of autonomy because of the physical separation of the code and deployment units, but you are likely to encounter problems because of changes in the implementation of one service leaking into the behavior of others. See Ben Christensen’s Don’t Build a Distributed Monolith.\nOrganizations that find themselves in this situation often react by trying to centrally coordinate deployment of multiple services, at which point you have lost the principal benefit of microservices while taking on the costs.

The key concept behind Pekko Persistence is that only the events that are persisted by the actor are stored, not the actual state of the actor (although actor state snapshot support is available). The events are persisted by appending to storage (nothing is ever mutated) which allows for very high transaction rates and efficient replication. A stateful actor is recovered by replaying the stored events to the actor, allowing it to rebuild its state. This can be either the full history of changes or starting from a checkpoint in a snapshot, which can dramatically reduce recovery times.\nPekko Persistence also supports Durable State Behaviors, which is based on persistence of the latest state of the actor. In this implementation, the latest state is persisted, instead of events. Hence this is more similar to CRUD based applications.\nThe Microservices with Pekko tutorial illustrates how to implement an Event Sourced CQRS application with Pekko Persistence and Pekko Projections.\nNote The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that personal information must be deleted at the request of users. Deleting or modifying events that carry personal information would be difficult. Data shredding can be used to forget information instead of deleting or modifying it. This is achieved by encrypting the data with a key for a given data subject id (person) and deleting the key when that data subject is to be forgotten.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/typed/persistence.html#event-sourcing-concepts","text":"See an introduction to Event Sourcing at MSDN.\nAnother excellent article about “thinking in Events” is Events As First-Class Citizens by Randy Shoup. It is a short and recommended read if you’re starting developing Events based applications.\nWhat follows is Pekko’s implementation via event sourced actors.\nAn event sourced actor (also known as a persistent actor) receives a (non-persistent) command which is first validated if it can be applied to the current state. Here validation can mean anything, from simple inspection of a command message’s fields up to a conversation with several external services, for example. If validation succeeds, events are generated from the command, representing the effect of the command. These events are then persisted and, after successful persistence, used to change the actor’s state. When the event sourced actor needs to be recovered, only the persisted events are replayed of which we know that they can be successfully applied.

In Pekko, this is now enforced by the type system.\nThe components that make up an EventSourcedBehaviorEventSourcedBehavior are:\npersistenceId is the stable unique identifier for the persistent actor. emptyState defines the State when the entity is first created e.g. a Counter would start with 0 as state. commandHandler defines how to handle command by producing Effects e.g. persisting events, stopping the persistent actor. eventHandler returns the new state given the current state when an event has been persisted.\nNote that the concrete class does not contain any fields with state like a regular POJO. All state of the EventSourcedBehavior must be represented in the State or else they will not be persisted and therefore be lost when the actor is stopped or restarted. Updates to the State are always performed in the eventHandler based on the events.\nNext we’ll discuss each of these in detail.","title":"Example and core API"},{"location":"/typed/persistence.html#persistenceid","text":"The PersistenceIdPersistenceId is the stable unique identifier for the persistent actor in the backend event journal and snapshot store.\nCluster Sharding is typically used together with EventSourcedBehavior to ensure that there is only one active entity for each PersistenceId (entityId). There are techniques to ensure this uniqueness, an example of which can be found in the Persistence example in the Cluster Sharding documentation. This illustrates how to construct the PersistenceId from the entityTypeKey and entityId provided by the EntityContextEntityContext.\nThe entityId in Cluster Sharding is the business domain identifier of the entity. The entityId might not be unique enough to be used as the PersistenceId by itself. For example two different types of entities may have the same entityId. To create a unique PersistenceId the entityId should be prefixed with a stable name of the entity type, which typically is the same as the EntityTypeKey.name that is used in Cluster Sharding. There are PersistenceId.applyPersistenceId.of factory methods to help with constructing such PersistenceId from an entityTypeHint and entityId.\nThe default separator when concatenating the entityTypeHint and entityId is |, but a custom separator is supported.\nNote The | separator is also used in Lagom’s scaladsl.PersistentEntity but no separator is used in Lagom’s javadsl.PersistentEntity.

Instead, the state is returned by eventHandler. The reason a new behavior can’t be returned is that behavior is part of the actor’s state and must also carefully be reconstructed during recovery. If it would have been supported it would mean that the behavior must be restored when replaying events and also encoded in the state anyway when snapshots are used. That would be very prone to mistakes and thus not allowed in Pekko Persistence.\nFor basic actors you can use the same set of command handlers independent of what state the entity is in, as shown in above example. For more complex actors it’s useful to be able to change the behavior in the sense that different functions for processing commands may be defined depending on what state the actor is in. This is useful when implementing finite state machine (FSM) like entities.\nThe next example demonstrates how to define different behavior based on the current State.

There is automatic replication of every event persisted to all replicas.\nFor instance, a replica can be run per:\nData Center Availability zone or rack\nThe motivations are:\nRedundancy to tolerate failures in one location and still be operational Serve requests from a location near the user to provide better responsiveness Balance the load over many servers\nHowever, the event handler must be able to handle concurrent events as when replication is enabled the single-writer guarantee is not maintained like it is with a normal EventSourcedBehavior.\nThe state of a replicated EventSourcedBehavior is eventually consistent.

Note that this is distinct from the CRDT’s implemented in Pekko Distributed Data, which are state-based rather than operation-based.\nThe rule for operation-based CRDT’s is that the operations must be commutative — in other words, applying the same events (which represent the operations) in any order should always produce the same final state.

Otherwise, there is a risk that the state in different replicas will be different and not eventually converge.\nAn example of that would be an entity representing a blog post and the fields author and title could be updated separately with events AuthorChanged(newAuthor: String)new AuthorChanged(newAuthor) and TitleChanged(newTitle: String)new TitleChanged(newTitle).\nLet’s say the blog post is created and the initial state of title=Pekko, author=unknown is in sync in both replicas DC-A and `DC-B.\nIn DC-A author is changed to “Bob” at time 100. Before that event has been replicated over to DC-B the title is updated to “Pekko News” at time 101 in DC-B. When the events have been replicated the result will be:\nDC-A: The title update is later so the event is used and new state is title=Pekko News, author=Bob\nDC-B: The author update is earlier so the event is discarded and state is title=Pekko News, author=unknown\nThe problem here is that the partial update of the state is not applied on both sides, so the states have diverged and will not become the same.\nTo solve this with last writer wins the events must carry the full state, such as AuthorChanged(newContent: PostContent)new AuthorChanged(newContent) and TitleChanged(newContent: PostContent)new TitleChanged(newContent). Then the result would eventually be title=Pekko News, author=unknown on both sides. The author update is lost but that is because the changes were performed concurrently. More important is that the state is eventually consistent.\nIncluding the full state in each event is often not desired. An event typically represent a change, a delta. Then one can use several timestamps, one for each set of fields that can be updated together. In the above example one could use one timestamp for the title and another for the author. Then the events could represent changes to parts of the full state, such as AuthorChanged(newAuthor: String)new AuthorChanged(newAuthor) and TitleChanged(newTitle: String)new TitleChanged(newTitle).","title":"Last writer wins"},{"location":"/typed/replicated-eventsourcing.html#side-effects","text":"In most cases it is recommended to do side effects as described for EventSourcedBehaviors.\nSide effects from the event handler are generally discouraged because the event handlers are also used during replay and when consuming replicated events and that would result in undesired re-execution of the side effects.\nUses cases for doing side effects in the event handler:\nDoing a side effect only in a single replica Doing a side effect once all replicas have seen an event A side effect for a replicated event A side effect when a conflict has occurred\nThere is no built in support for knowing an event has been replicated to all replicas but it can be modelled in your state.

This is useful for later retrival of events for a given tag. The same API for tagging provided for EventSourcedBehavior can be used for replicated event sourced behaviors as well. Tagging is useful in practice to build queries that lead to other data representations or aggregations of these event streams that can more directly serve user queries – known as building the “read side” in CQRS based applications.\nCreating read side projections is possible through Pekko Projection or through direct usage of the events by tag queries.\nThe tagging is invoked in each replicas, which requires some special care in using tags, or else the same event will be tagged one time for each replica and show up in the event by tag stream one time for each replica. In addition to this the tags will be written in the respective journal of the replicas, which means that unless they all share a single journal the tag streams will be local to the replica even if the same tag is used on multiple replicas.\nOne strategy for dealing with this is to include the replica id in the tag name, this means there will be a tagged stream of events per replica that contains all replicated events, but since the events can arrive in different order, they can also come in different order per replica tag.\nAnother strategy would be to tag only the events that are local to the replica and not events that are replicated. Either using a tag that will be the same for all replicas, leading to a single stream of tagged events where the events from each replica is present only once, or with a tag including the replica id meaning that there will be a stream of tagged events with the events accepted locally for each replica.\nDetermining the replica id of the replicated actor itself and the origin replica id of an event is possible through the ReplicationContextReplicationContext when the tagger callback is invoked like this:\nScala copysourceReplicatedEventSourcing.commonJournalConfig(\n  ReplicationId(\"TaggingSpec\", entityId, replica),\n  allReplicas,\n  queryPluginId)(replicationContext =>\n  EventSourcedBehavior[Command, String, State](\n    replicationContext.persistenceId,\n    State(Set.empty),\n    (state, command) =>\n      command match {\n        case Add(string, ack) =>\n          if (state.strings.contains(string)) Effect.none.thenRun(_ => ack !

mutable or immutable. When it is immutable the event handler returns a new instance of the state for each change. When using mutable state it’s important to not send the full state instance as a message to another actor, e.g. as a reply to a command. Messages must be immutable to avoid concurrency problems. The above examples are using immutable state classes and below is corresponding example with mutable state.

domain using event sourced actors, you may notice that some actors may be prone to accumulating extremely long event logs and experiencing long recovery times. Sometimes, the right approach may be to split out into a set of shorter lived actors. However, when this is not an option, you can use snapshots to reduce recovery times drastically.\nPersistent actors can save snapshots of internal state every N events or when a given predicate of the state is fulfilled.\nScala copysource import org.apache.pekko.persistence.typed.scaladsl.Effect\n\nEventSourcedBehavior[Command, Event, State](\n  persistenceId = PersistenceId.ofUniqueId(\"abc\"),\n  emptyState = State(),\n  commandHandler = (state, cmd) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the command & return an Effect\"),\n  eventHandler = (state, evt) => state) // do something based on a particular state\n  .snapshotWhen {\n    case (state, BookingCompleted(_), sequenceNumber) => true\n    case (state, event, sequenceNumber)               => false\n  }\n  .withRetention(RetentionCriteria.snapshotEvery(numberOfEvents = 100, keepNSnapshots = 2)) Java copysource@Override // override retentionCriteria in EventSourcedBehavior\npublic RetentionCriteria retentionCriteria() {\n  return RetentionCriteria.snapshotEvery(100, 2);\n}\nScala copysourceEventSourcedBehavior[Command, Event, State](\n  persistenceId = PersistenceId.ofUniqueId(\"abc\"),\n  emptyState = State(),\n  commandHandler = (state, cmd) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the command & return an Effect\"),\n  eventHandler = (state, evt) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the event return the next state\"))\n  .snapshotWhen {\n    case (state, BookingCompleted(_), sequenceNumber) => true\n    case (state, event, sequenceNumber)               => false\n  } Java copysource@Override // override shouldSnapshot in EventSourcedBehavior\npublic boolean shouldSnapshot(State state, Event event, long sequenceNr) {\n  return event instanceof BookingCompleted;\n}\nWhen a snapshot is triggered, incoming commands are stashed until the snapshot has been saved. This means that the state can safely be mutable although the serialization and storage of the state is performed asynchronously. The state instance will not be updated by new events until after the snapshot has been saved.\nDuring recovery, the persistent actor is using the latest saved snapshot to initialize the state. Thereafter the events after the snapshot are replayed using the event handler to recover the persistent actor to its current (i.e. latest) state.\nIf not specified, they default to SnapshotSelectionCriteria.LatestSnapshotSelectionCriteria.latest() which selects the latest (youngest) snapshot. It’s possible to override the selection of which snapshot to use for recovery like this:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.persistence.typed.SnapshotSelectionCriteria\n\nEventSourcedBehavior[Command, Event, State](\n  persistenceId = PersistenceId.ofUniqueId(\"abc\"),\n  emptyState = State(),\n  commandHandler = (state, cmd) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the command & return an Effect\"),\n  eventHandler = (state, evt) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the event return the next state\"))\n  .withRecovery(Recovery.withSnapshotSelectionCriteria(SnapshotSelectionCriteria.none)) Java copysource@Override\npublic Recovery recovery() {\n  return Recovery.withSnapshotSelectionCriteria(SnapshotSelectionCriteria.none());\n}\nTo disable snapshot-based recovery, applications can use SnapshotSelectionCriteria.NoneSnapshotSelectionCriteria.none(). A recovery where no saved snapshot matches the specified SnapshotSelectionCriteria will replay all journaled events. This can be useful if snapshot serialization format has changed in an incompatible way. It should typically not be used when events have been deleted.\nIn order to use snapshots, a default snapshot-store (pekko.persistence.snapshot-store.plugin) must be configured, or you can pick a snapshot store for for a specific EventSourcedBehavior by defining it with withSnapshotPluginId of the EventSourcedBehavioroverriding snapshotPluginId in the EventSourcedBehavior.\nBecause some use cases may not benefit from or need snapshots, it is perfectly valid not to not configure a snapshot store. However, Pekko will log a warning message when this situation is detected and then continue to operate until an actor tries to store a snapshot, at which point the operation will fail.","title":"Snapshots"},{"location":"/typed/persistence-snapshot.html#snapshot-failures","text":"Saving snapshots can either succeed or fail – this information is reported back to the persistent actor via the SnapshotCompleted or SnapshotFailed signal. Snapshot failures are logged by default but do not cause the actor to stop or restart.\nIf there is a problem with recovering the state of the actor from the journal when the actor is started, RecoveryFailed signal is emitted (logging the error by default), and the actor will be stopped.

When snapshot loading fails it will instead recover by replaying all events.\nEnable this feature by setting snapshot-is-optional = true in the snapshot store configuration.\nWarning Don’t set snapshot-is-optional = true if events have been deleted because that would result in wrong recovered state if snapshot load fails.","title":"Optional snapshots"},{"location":"/typed/persistence-snapshot.html#snapshot-deletion","text":"To free up space, an event sourced actor can automatically delete older snapshots based on the given RetentionCriteria.\nScala copysource import org.apache.pekko.persistence.typed.scaladsl.Effect\n\nEventSourcedBehavior[Command, Event, State](\n  persistenceId = PersistenceId.ofUniqueId(\"abc\"),\n  emptyState = State(),\n  commandHandler = (state, cmd) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the command & return an Effect\"),\n  eventHandler = (state, evt) => state) // do something based on a particular state\n  .snapshotWhen {\n    case (state, BookingCompleted(_), sequenceNumber) => true\n    case (state, event, sequenceNumber)               => false\n  }\n  .withRetention(RetentionCriteria.snapshotEvery(numberOfEvents = 100, keepNSnapshots = 2)) Java copysource@Override // override retentionCriteria in EventSourcedBehavior\npublic RetentionCriteria retentionCriteria() {\n  return RetentionCriteria.snapshotEvery(100, 2);\n}\n@Override // override shouldSnapshot in EventSourcedBehavior\npublic boolean shouldSnapshot(State state, Event event, long sequenceNr) {\n  return event instanceof BookingCompleted;\n}\nSnapshot deletion is triggered after saving a new snapshot.\nThe above example will save snapshots automatically every numberOfEvents = 100.

The corresponding plugins must be configured in the actor system which is used to initialize the particular testkit class:\nScala copysource val yourConfiguration = ConfigFactory.defaultApplication()\n\nval system =\n  ActorSystem(??? /*some behavior*/, \"test-system\", PersistenceTestKitPlugin.config.withFallback(yourConfiguration))\n\nval testKit = PersistenceTestKit(system)\n Java copysourcepublic class PersistenceTestKitConfig {\n\n  Config conf =\n      PersistenceTestKitPlugin.getInstance()\n          .config()\n          .withFallback(ConfigFactory.defaultApplication());\n\n  ActorSystem<Command> system = ActorSystem.create(new SomeBehavior(), \"example\", conf);\n\n  PersistenceTestKit testKit = PersistenceTestKit.create(system);\n}\nand\nScala copysource val yourConfiguration = ConfigFactory.defaultApplication()\n\nval system = ActorSystem(\n  ??? /*some behavior*/,\n  \"test-system\",\n  PersistenceTestKitSnapshotPlugin.config.withFallback(yourConfiguration))\n\nval testKit = SnapshotTestKit(system)\n Java copysourcepublic class SnapshotTestKitConfig {\n\n  Config conf =\n      PersistenceTestKitSnapshotPlugin.getInstance()\n          .config()\n          .withFallback(ConfigFactory.defaultApplication());\n\n  ActorSystem<Command> system = ActorSystem.create(new SomeBehavior(), \"example\", conf);\n\n  SnapshotTestKit testKit = SnapshotTestKit.create(system);\n}\nA typical scenario is to create a persistent actor, send commands to it and check that it persists events as it is expected:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.testkit.typed.scaladsl.ScalaTestWithActorTestKit\nimport pekko.persistence.testkit.PersistenceTestKitPlugin\nimport pekko.persistence.testkit.scaladsl.PersistenceTestKit\n\nclass PersistenceTestKitSampleSpec\n    extends ScalaTestWithActorTestKit(PersistenceTestKitPlugin.config.withFallback(ConfigFactory.defaultApplication()))\n    with AnyWordSpecLike\n    with BeforeAndAfterEach {\n\n  val persistenceTestKit = PersistenceTestKit(system)\n\n  override def beforeEach(): Unit = {\n    persistenceTestKit.clearAll()\n  }\n\n  \"Persistent actor\" should {\n\n    \"persist all events\" in {\n\n      val persistenceId = PersistenceId.ofUniqueId(\"your-persistence-id\")\n      val persistentActor = spawn(\n        EventSourcedBehavior[Cmd, Evt, State](\n          persistenceId,\n          emptyState = State.empty,\n          commandHandler = (_, cmd) => Effect.persist(Evt(cmd.data)),\n          eventHandler = (state, evt) => state.updated(evt)))\n      val cmd = Cmd(\"data\")\n\n      persistentActor !

WriteEventsWriteEvents Write the events to the storage. DeleteEventsDeleteEvents Delete the events from the storage. ReadSeqNumReadSeqNum Read the highest sequence number for particular persistence id.\nSnapshot storage has the following operations:\nReadSnapshotReadSnapshot Read the snapshot from the storage. WriteSnapshotWriteSnapshot Write the snapshot to the storage. DeleteSnapshotsByCriteriaDeleteSnapshotsByCriteria Delete snapshots in the storage by criteria. DeleteSnapshotByMetaDeleteSnapshotByMeta Delete particular snapshot from the storage by its metadata.\nThe tryProcess() method must return one of the processing results:\nProcessingSuccessProcessingSuccess Successful completion of the operation. All the events will be saved/read/deleted. StorageFailureStorageFailure Emulates exception from the storage. RejectReject Emulates rejection from the storage.\nNote that snapshot storage does not have rejections. If you return Reject in the tryProcess() of the snapshot storage policy, it will have the same effect as the StorageFailure.\nHere is an example of the policy for an event storage:\nScala

For an excellent overview why and how immutable data makes scalability and systems design much simpler you may want to read Pat Helland’s excellent Immutability Changes Everything whitepaper.\nSince with Event Sourcing the events are immutable and usually never deleted – the way schema evolution is handled differs from how one would go about it in a mutable database setting (e.g. in typical CRUD database applications).\nThe system needs to be able to continue to work in the presence of “old” events which were stored under the “old” schema. We also want to limit complexity in the business logic layer, exposing a consistent view over all of the events of a given type to PersistentActorAbstractPersistentActor s and persistence queries. This allows the business logic layer to focus on solving business problems instead of having to explicitly deal with different schemas.\nIn summary, schema evolution in event sourced systems exposes the following characteristics:\nAllow the system to continue operating without large scale migrations to be applied, Allow the system to read “old” events from the underlying storage, however present them in a “new” view to the application logic, Transparently promote events to the latest versions during recovery (or queries) such that the business logic need not consider multiple versions of events","title":"Schema evolution in event-sourced systems"},{"location":"/persistence-schema-evolution.html#types-of-schema-evolution","text":"Before we explain the various techniques that can be used to safely evolve the schema of your persistent events over time, we first need to define what the actual problem is, and what the typical styles of changes are.\nSince events are never deleted, we need to have a way to be able to replay (read) old events, in such way that does not force the PersistentActorAbstractPersistentActor to be aware of all possible versions of an event that it may have persisted in the past. Instead, we want the Actors to work on some form of “latest” version of the event and provide some means of either converting old “versions” of stored events into this “latest” event type, or constantly evolve the event definition - in a backwards compatible way - such that the new deserialization code can still read old events.\nThe most common schema changes you will likely are:\nadding a field to an event type, remove or rename field in event type, remove event type, split event into multiple smaller events.\nThe following sections will explain some patterns which can be used to safely evolve your schema when facing those changes.","title":"Types of schema evolution"},{"location":"/persistence-schema-evolution.html#picking-the-right-serialization-format","text":"Picking the serialization format is a very important decision you will have to make while building your application. It affects which kind of evolutions are simple (or hard) to do, how much work is required to add a new datatype, and, last but not least, serialization performance.\nIf you find yourself realising you have picked “the wrong” serialization format, it is always possible to change the format used for storing new events, however you would have to keep the old deserialization code in order to be able to replay events that were persisted using the old serialization scheme. It is possible to “rebuild” an event-log from one serialization format to another one, however it may be a more involved process if you need to perform this on a live system.\nSerialization with Jackson is a good choice in many cases and our recommendation if you don’t have other preference. It also has support for Schema Evolution.\nGoogle Protocol Buffers is good if you want more control over the schema evolution of your messages, but it requires more work to develop and maintain the mapping between serialized representation and domain representation.\nBinary serialization formats that we have seen work well for long-lived applications include the very flexible IDL based: Google Protocol Buffers, Apache Thrift or Apache Avro. Avro schema evolution is more “entire schema” based, instead of single fields focused like in protobuf or thrift, and usually requires using some kind of schema registry.\nThere are plenty excellent blog posts explaining the various trade-offs between popular serialization formats, one post we would like to highlight is the very well illustrated Schema evolution in Avro, Protocol Buffers and Thrift by Martin Kleppmann.","title":"Picking the right serialization format"},{"location":"/persistence-schema-evolution.html#provided-default-serializers","text":"Pekko Persistence provides Google Protocol Buffers based serializers (using Pekko Serialization) for its own message types such as PersistentReprPersistentRepr, AtomicWriteAtomicWrite and snapshots. Journal plugin implementations may choose to use those provided serializers, or pick a serializer which suits the underlying database better.\nNote Serialization is NOT handled automatically by Pekko Persistence itself. Instead, it only provides the above described serializers, and in case a AsyncWriteJournalAsyncWriteJournal plugin implementation chooses to use them directly, the above serialization scheme will be used. Please refer to your write journal’s documentation to learn more about how it handles serialization! For example, some journals may choose to not use Pekko Serialization at all and instead store the data in a format that is more “native” for the underlying datastore, e.g. using JSON or some other kind of format that the target datastore understands directly.\nThe below figure explains how the default serialization scheme works, and how it fits together with serializing the user provided message itself, which we will from here on refer to as the payload (highlighted in yellow):\nPekko Persistence provided serializers wrap the user payload in an envelope containing all persistence-relevant information. If the Journal uses provided Protobuf serializers for the wrapper types (e.g. PersistentRepr), then the payload will be serialized using the user configured serializer, and if none is provided explicitly, Java serialization will be used for it.\nThe blue colored regions of the PersistentMessage indicate what is serialized using the generated protocol buffers serializers, and the yellow payload indicates the user provided event (by calling persist(payload)(...)persist(payload,...). As you can see, the PersistentMessage acts as an envelope around the payload, adding various fields related to the origin of the event (persistenceId, sequenceNr and more).\nMore advanced techniques (e.g. Remove event class and ignore events) will dive into using the manifests for increasing the flexibility of the persisted vs. exposed types even more. However for now we will focus on the simpler evolution techniques, concerning only configuring the payload serializers.\nBy default the payload will be serialized using Java Serialization. This is fine for testing and initial phases of your development (while you’re still figuring out things, and the data will not need to stay persisted forever). However, once you move to production you should really pick a different serializer for your payloads.\nWarning Do not rely on Java serialization for serious application development! It does not lean itself well to evolving schemas over long periods of time, and its performance is also not very high (it never was designed for high-throughput scenarios).","title":"Provided default serializers"},{"location":"/persistence-schema-evolution.html#configuring-payload-serializers","text":"This section aims to highlight the complete basics on how to define custom serializers using Pekko Serialization.

This is achieved using the right serializer toolkit. In the following examples we will be using protobuf.

Optional fields can be handled explicitly or missing values by calling the has... methods on the protobuf object, which we do for seatType in order to use a Unknown type in case the event was stored before we had introduced the field to this event type:\nScala copysource/**\n * Example serializer impl which uses protocol buffers generated classes (proto.*)\n * to perform the to/from binary marshalling.\n */\nclass AddedFieldsSerializerWithProtobuf extends SerializerWithStringManifest {\n  override def identifier = 67876\n\n  final val SeatReservedManifest = classOf[SeatReserved].getName\n\n  override def manifest(o: AnyRef): String = o.getClass.getName\n\n  override def fromBinary(bytes: Array[Byte], manifest: String): AnyRef =\n    manifest match {\n      case SeatReservedManifest =>\n        // use generated protobuf serializer\n        seatReserved(FlightAppModels.SeatReserved.parseFrom(bytes))\n      case _ =>\n        throw new NotSerializableException(\"Unable to handle manifest: \" + manifest)\n    }\n\n  override def toBinary(o: AnyRef): Array[Byte] = o match {\n    case s: SeatReserved =>\n      FlightAppModels.SeatReserved.newBuilder\n        .setRow(s.row)\n        .setLetter(s.letter)\n        .setSeatType(s.seatType.code)\n        .build()\n        .toByteArray\n  }\n\n  // -- fromBinary helpers --\n\n  private def seatReserved(p: FlightAppModels.SeatReserved): SeatReserved =\n    SeatReserved(p.getLetter, p.getRow, seatType(p))\n\n  // handle missing field by assigning \"Unknown\" value\n  private def seatType(p: FlightAppModels.SeatReserved): SeatType =\n    if (p.hasSeatType) SeatType.fromString(p.getSeatType) else SeatType.Unknown\n\n} Java copysource/**\n * Example serializer impl which uses protocol buffers generated classes (proto.*) to perform the\n * to/from binary marshalling.\n */\nstatic class AddedFieldsSerializerWithProtobuf extends SerializerWithStringManifest {\n  @Override\n  public int identifier() {\n    return 67876;\n  }\n\n  private final String seatReservedManifest = SeatReserved.class.getName();\n\n  @Override\n  public String manifest(Object o) {\n    return o.getClass().getName();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Object fromBinary(byte[] bytes, String manifest) throws NotSerializableException {\n    if (seatReservedManifest.equals(manifest)) {\n      // use generated protobuf serializer\n      try {\n        return seatReserved(FlightAppModels.SeatReserved.parseFrom(bytes));\n      } catch (InvalidProtocolBufferException e) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(e.getMessage());\n      }\n    } else {\n      throw new NotSerializableException(\"Unable to handle manifest: \" + manifest);\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public byte[] toBinary(Object o) {\n    if (o instanceof SeatReserved) {\n      SeatReserved s = (SeatReserved) o;\n      return FlightAppModels.SeatReserved.newBuilder()\n          .setRow(s.row)\n          .setLetter(s.letter)\n          .setSeatType(s.seatType.code)\n          .build()\n          .toByteArray();\n\n    } else {\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unable to handle: \" + o);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // -- fromBinary helpers --\n\n  private SeatReserved seatReserved(FlightAppModels.SeatReserved p) {\n    return new SeatReserved(p.getLetter(), p.getRow(), seatType(p));\n  }\n\n  // handle missing field by assigning \"Unknown\" value\n  private SeatType seatType(FlightAppModels.SeatReserved p) {\n    if (p.hasSeatType()) return SeatType.fromCode(p.getSeatType());\n    else return SeatType.Unknown;\n  }\n}","title":"Add fields"},{"location":"/persistence-schema-evolution.html#rename-fields","text":"Situation: When first designing the system the SeatReserved event featured a code field. After some time you discover that what was originally called code actually means seatNr, thus the model should be changed to reflect this concept more accurately.\nSolution 1 - using IDL based serializers: First, we will discuss the most efficient way of dealing with such kinds of schema changes – IDL based serializers.\nIDL stands for Interface Description Language, and means that the schema of the messages that will be stored is based on this description. Most IDL based serializers also generate the serializer / deserializer code so that using them is not too hard. Examples of such serializers are protobuf or thrift.\nUsing these libraries rename operations are “free”, because the field name is never actually stored in the binary representation of the message. This is one of the advantages of schema based serializers, even though that they add the overhead of having to maintain the schema. When using serializers like this, no additional code change (except renaming the field and method used during serialization) is needed to perform such evolution:\nThis is how such a rename would look in protobuf:\ncopysource// protobuf message definition, BEFORE:\nmessage SeatReserved {\n  required string code = 1;\n}\n\n// protobuf message definition, AFTER:\nmessage SeatReserved {\n  required string seatNr = 1; // field renamed, id remains the same\n}\nIt is important to learn about the strengths and limitations of your serializers, in order to be able to move swiftly and refactor your models fearlessly as you go on with the project.\nNote Learn in-depth about the serialization engine you’re using as it will impact how you can approach schema evolution. Some operations are “free” in certain serialization formats (more often than not: removing/adding optional fields, sometimes renaming fields etc.), while some other operations are strictly not possible.\nSolution 2 - by manually handling the event versions: Another solution, in case your serialization format does not support renames like the above mentioned formats, is versioning your schema. For example, you could have made your events carry an additional field called _version which was set to 1 (because it was the initial schema), and once you change the schema you bump this number to 2, and write an adapter which can perform the rename.\nThis approach is popular when your serialization format is something like JSON, where renames can not be performed automatically by the serializer. See also how to rename fields with Jackson, which is using this kind of versioning approach.\nThe following snippet showcases how one could apply renames if working with plain JSON (using spray.json.JsObjecta JsObject as an example JSON representation):\nScala copysourceclass JsonRenamedFieldAdapter extends EventAdapter {\n  val marshaller = new ExampleJsonMarshaller\n\n  val V1 = \"v1\"\n  val V2 = \"v2\"\n\n  // this could be done independently for each event type\n  override def manifest(event: Any): String = V2\n\n  override def toJournal(event: Any): JsObject =\n    marshaller.toJson(event)\n\n  override def fromJournal(event: Any, manifest: String): EventSeq = event match {\n    case json: JsObject =>\n      EventSeq(marshaller.fromJson(manifest match {\n        case V1      => rename(json, \"code\", \"seatNr\")\n        case V2      => json // pass-through\n        case unknown => throw new IllegalArgumentException(s\"Unknown manifest: $unknown\")\n      }))\n    case _ =>\n      val c = event.getClass\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Can only work with JSON, was: %s\".format(c))\n  }\n\n  def rename(json: JsObject, from: String, to: String): JsObject = {\n    val value = json.fields(from)\n    val withoutOld = json.fields - from\n    JsObject(withoutOld + (to -> value))\n  }\n\n} Java copysourcestatic class JsonRenamedFieldAdapter implements EventAdapter {\n  // use your favorite json library\n  private final ExampleJsonMarshaller marshaller = new ExampleJsonMarshaller();\n\n  private final String V1 = \"v1\";\n  private final String V2 = \"v2\";\n\n  // this could be done independently for each event type\n  @Override\n  public String manifest(Object event) {\n    return V2;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public JsObject toJournal(Object event) {\n    return marshaller.toJson(event);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public EventSeq fromJournal(Object event, String manifest) {\n    if (event instanceof JsObject) {\n      JsObject json = (JsObject) event;\n      if (V1.equals(manifest)) json = rename(json, \"code\", \"seatNr\");\n      return EventSeq.single(json);\n    } else {\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n          \"Can only work with JSON, was: \" + event.getClass().getName());\n    }\n  }\n\n  private JsObject rename(JsObject json, String from, String to) {\n    // use your favorite json library to rename the field\n    JsObject renamed = json;\n    return renamed;\n  }\n}\nAs you can see, manually handling renames induces some boilerplate onto the EventAdapter, however much of it you will find is common infrastructure code that can be either provided by an external library (for promotion management) or put together in a simple helper traitclass.\nNote The technique of versioning events and then promoting them to the latest version using JSON transformations can be applied to more than just field renames – it also applies to adding fields and all kinds of changes in the message format.","title":"Rename fields"},{"location":"/persistence-schema-evolution.html#remove-event-class-and-ignore-events","text":"Situation: While investigating app performance you notice that unreasonable amounts of CustomerBlinked events are being stored for every customer each time he/she blinks. Upon investigation, you decide that the event does not add any value and should be deleted. You still have to be able to replay from a journal which contains those old CustomerBlinked events though.\nNaive solution - drop events in EventAdapter:\nThe problem of removing an event type from the domain model is not as much its removal, as the implications for the recovery mechanisms that this entails. For example, a naive way of filtering out certain kinds of events from being delivered to a recovering PersistentActor is pretty simple, as one can filter them out in an EventAdapter:\nThe EventAdapterEventAdapter can drop old events (**O**) by emitting an empty EventSeqEventSeq. Other events can be passed through (**E**).\nThis however does not address the underlying cost of having to deserialize all the events during recovery, even those which will be filtered out by the adapter. In the next section we will improve the above explained mechanism to avoid deserializing events which would be filtered out by the adapter anyway, thus allowing to save precious time during a recovery containing lots of such events (without actually having to delete them).\nImproved solution - deserialize into tombstone:\nIn the just described technique we have saved the PersistentActor from receiving un-wanted events by filtering them out in the EventAdapterEventAdapter, however the event itself still was deserialized and loaded into memory. This has two notable downsides:\nfirst, that the deserialization was actually performed, so we spent some of our time budget on the deserialization, even though the event does not contribute anything to the persistent actors state. second, that we are unable to remove the event class from the system – since the serializer still needs to create the actual instance of it, as it does not know it will not be used.\nThe solution to these problems is to use a serializer that is aware of that event being no longer needed, and can notice this before starting to deserialize the object.\nThis approach allows us to remove the original class from our classpath, which makes for less “old” classes lying around in the project. This can for example be implemented by using an SerializerWithStringManifestSerializerWithStringManifest (documented in depth in Serializer with String Manifest). By looking at the string manifest, the serializer can notice that the type is no longer needed, and skip the deserialization all-together:\nThe serializer is aware of the old event types that need to be skipped (**O**), and can skip deserializing them altogether by returning a “tombstone” (**T**), which the EventAdapter converts into an empty EventSeq.

For example because the data representation may change independently of the domain model.\nAnother situation where this technique may be useful is when your serialization tool of choice requires generated classes to be used for serialization and deserialization of objects, like for example Google Protocol Buffers do, yet you do not want to leak this implementation detail into the domain model itself, which you’d like to model as plain Scala caseJava classes.\nSolution: In order to detach the domain model, which is often represented using pure Scala (case)Java classes, from the data model classes which very often may be less user-friendly yet highly optimised for throughput and schema evolution (like the classes generated by protobuf for example), it is possible to use a simple EventAdapter which maps between these types in a 1:1 style as illustrated below:\nDomain events (**A**) are adapted to the data model events (**D**) by the EventAdapter. The data model can be a format natively understood by the journal, such that it can store it more efficiently or include additional data for the event (e.g. tags), for ease of later querying.\nWe will use the following domain and data models to showcase how the separation can be implemented by the adapter:\nScala copysource/** Domain model - highly optimised for domain language and maybe \"fluent\" usage */\nobject DomainModel {\n  final case class Customer(name: String)\n  final case class Seat(code: String) {\n    def bookFor(customer: Customer): SeatBooked = SeatBooked(code, customer)\n  }\n\n  final case class SeatBooked(code: String, customer: Customer)\n}\n\n/** Data model - highly optimised for schema evolution and persistence */\nobject DataModel {\n  final case class SeatBooked(code: String, customerName: String)\n} Java copysource// Domain model - highly optimised for domain language and maybe \"fluent\" usage\nstatic class Customer {\n  public final String name;\n\n  public Customer(String name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\nstatic class Seat {\n  public final String code;\n\n  public Seat(String code) {\n    this.code = code;\n  }\n\n  public SeatBooked bookFor(Customer customer) {\n    return new SeatBooked(code, customer);\n  }\n}\n\nstatic class SeatBooked {\n  public final String code;\n  public final Customer customer;\n\n  public SeatBooked(String code, Customer customer) {\n    this.code = code;\n    this.customer = customer;\n  }\n}\n\n// Data model - highly optimised for schema evolution and persistence\nstatic class SeatBookedData {\n  public final String code;\n  public final String customerName;\n\n  public SeatBookedData(String code, String customerName) {\n    this.code = code;\n    this.customerName = customerName;\n  }\n}\nThe EventAdapterEventAdapter takes care of converting from one model to the other one (in both directions), allowing the models to be completely detached from each other, such that they can be optimised independently as long as the mapping logic is able to convert between them:\nScala copysourceclass DetachedModelsAdapter extends EventAdapter {\n  override def manifest(event: Any): String = \"\"\n\n  override def toJournal(event: Any): Any = event match {\n    case DomainModel.SeatBooked(code, customer) =>\n      DataModel.SeatBooked(code, customer.name)\n  }\n  override def fromJournal(event: Any, manifest: String): EventSeq = event match {\n    case DataModel.SeatBooked(code, customerName) =>\n      EventSeq(DomainModel.SeatBooked(code, DomainModel.Customer(customerName)))\n  }\n} Java copysourceclass DetachedModelsAdapter implements EventAdapter {\n  @Override\n  public String manifest(Object event) {\n    return \"\";\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Object toJournal(Object event) {\n    if (event instanceof SeatBooked) {\n      SeatBooked s = (SeatBooked) event;\n      return new SeatBookedData(s.code, s.customer.name);\n    } else {\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported: \" + event.getClass());\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public EventSeq fromJournal(Object event, String manifest) {\n    if (event instanceof SeatBookedData) {\n      SeatBookedData d = (SeatBookedData) event;\n      return EventSeq.single(new SeatBooked(d.code, new Customer(d.customerName)));\n    } else {\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported: \" + event.getClass());\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe same technique could also be used directly in the Serializer if the end result of marshalling is bytes.

Pekko Persistence Query itself is not directly the query side of an application, however it can help to migrate data from the write side to the query side database. In very simple scenarios Persistence Query may be powerful enough to fulfill the query needs of your app, however we highly recommend (in the spirit of CQRS) of splitting up the write/read sides into separate datastores as the need arises.\nFor a similar implementation of query interface to Durable State Behaviors please refer to Persistence Query using Durable State.\nThe Microservices with Pekko tutorial explains how to implement an Event Sourced CQRS application with Pekko Persistence and Pekko Projections.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/persistence-query.html#design-overview","text":"Pekko persistence query is purposely designed to be a very loosely specified API.

This query is hard to implement in some journals or may need some additional preparation of the used data store to be executed efficiently. The goal of this query is to allow querying for all events which are “tagged” with a specific tag. That includes the use case to query all domain events of an Aggregate Root type. Please refer to your read journal plugin’s documentation to find out if and how it is supported.\nSome journals may support tagging of events or Event Adapters that wraps the events in a persistence.journal.Taggedpersistence.journal.Tagged with the given tags. The journal may support other ways of doing tagging - again, how exactly this is implemented depends on the used journal. Here is an example of such a tagging with an EventSourcedBehaviorEventSourcedBehavior:\nScala copysourceval NumberOfEntityGroups = 10\n\ndef tagEvent(entityId: String, event: Event): Set[String] = {\n  val entityGroup = s\"group-${math.abs(entityId.hashCode % NumberOfEntityGroups)}\"\n  event match {\n    case _: OrderCompleted => Set(entityGroup, \"order-completed\")\n    case _                 => Set(entityGroup)\n  }\n}\n\ndef apply(entityId: String): Behavior[Command] = {\n  EventSourcedBehavior[Command, Event, State](\n    persistenceId = PersistenceId(\"ShoppingCart\", entityId),\n    emptyState = State(),\n    commandHandler = (state, cmd) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the command & return an Effect\"),\n    eventHandler = (state, evt) => throw new NotImplementedError(\"TODO: process the event return the next state\"))\n    .withTagger(event => tagEvent(entityId, event))\n} Java copysourceprivate final String entityId;\n\npublic static final int NUMBER_OF_ENTITY_GROUPS = 10;\n\n@Override\npublic Set<String> tagsFor(Event event) {\n  String entityGroup = \"group-\" + Math.abs(entityId.hashCode() % NUMBER_OF_ENTITY_GROUPS);\n  Set<String> tags = new HashSet<>();\n  tags.add(entityGroup);\n  if (event instanceof OrderCompleted) tags.add(\"order-completed\");\n  return tags;\n}\nNote A very important thing to keep in mind when using queries spanning multiple persistenceIds, such as EventsByTagEventsByTag is that the order of events at which the events appear in the stream rarely is guaranteed (or stable between materializations). Journals may choose to opt for strict ordering of the events, and should then document explicitly what kind of ordering guarantee they provide - for example “ordered by timestamp ascending, independently of persistenceId” is easy to achieve on relational databases, yet may be hard to implement efficiently on plain key-value datastores.\nIn the example below we query all events which have been tagged (we assume this was performed by the write-side using tagging of events or Event Adapters, or that the journal is smart enough that it can figure out what we mean by this tag - for example if the journal stored the events as json it may try to find those with the field tag set to this value etc.).\nScala copysource// assuming journal is able to work with numeric offsets we can:\n\nval completedOrders: Source[EventEnvelope, NotUsed] =\n  readJournal.eventsByTag(\"order-completed\", Offset.noOffset)\n\n// find first 10 completed orders:\nval firstCompleted: Future[Vector[OrderCompleted]] =\n  completedOrders\n    .map(_.event)\n    .collectType[OrderCompleted]\n    .take(10) // cancels the query stream after pulling 10 elements\n    .runFold(Vector.empty[OrderCompleted])(_ :+ _)\n\n// start another query, from the known offset\nval furtherOrders = readJournal.eventsByTag(\"order-completed\", offset = Sequence(10)) Java copysource// assuming journal is able to work with numeric offsets we can:\nfinal Source<EventEnvelope, NotUsed> completedOrders =\n    readJournal.eventsByTag(\"order-completed\", new Sequence(0L));\n\n// find first 10 completed orders:\nfinal CompletionStage<List<OrderCompleted>> firstCompleted =\n    completedOrders\n        .map(EventEnvelope::event)\n        .collectType(OrderCompleted.class)\n        .take(10) // cancels the query stream after pulling 10 elements\n        .runFold(\n            new ArrayList<>(10),\n            (acc, e) -> {\n              acc.add(e);\n              return acc;\n            },\n            system);\n\n// start another query, from the known offset\nSource<EventEnvelope, NotUsed> furtherOrders =\n    readJournal.eventsByTag(\"order-completed\", new Sequence(10));\nAs you can see, we can use all the usual stream operators available from Streams on the resulting query stream, including for example taking the first 10 and cancelling the stream. It is worth pointing out that the built-in EventsByTag query has an optionally supported offset parameter (of type Long) which the journals can use to implement resumable-streams. For example a journal may be able to use a WHERE clause to begin the read starting from a specific row, or in a datastore that is able to order events by insertion time it could treat the Long as a timestamp and select only older events.\nIf your usage does not require a live stream, you can use the currentEventsByTagcurrentEventsByTag query.","title":"EventsByTag and CurrentEventsByTag"},{"location":"/persistence-query.html#eventsbyslice-and-currenteventsbyslice","text":"Query events for given entity type and slices.

When a new bid is registered,\nit needs to be decided whether the new bid is the winning bid or not the state needs to be updated accordingly\nThe point of CRDTs is that the state must be end up being the same regardless of the order the events have been processed. We can see how this works in the auction example: we are only interested in the highest bid, so, if we can define an ordering on all bids, it should suffice to compare the new bid with currently highest to eventually end up with the globally highest regardless of the order in which the events come in.\nThe ordering between bids is crucial, therefore. We need to ensure that it is deterministic and does not depend on local state outside of our state class so that all replicas come to the same result. We define the ordering as this:\nA higher bid wins. If there’s a tie between the two highest bids, the bid that was registered earlier wins. For that we keep track of the (local) timestamp the bid was registered. We need to make sure that no timestamp is used twice in the same replica (missing in this example). If there’s a tie between the timestamp, we define an arbitrary but deterministic ordering on the replicas, in our case we just compare the name strings of the replicas. That’s why we need to keep the identifier of the replica where a bid was registered for every Bid.\nIf the new bid was higher, we keep this one as the new highest and keep the amount of the former highest as the highestCounterOffer. If the new bid was lower, we just update the highestCounterOffer if necessary.\nUsing those rules, the order of incoming does not matter. Replicas will eventually converge to the same result.","title":"Auction example"},{"location":"/typed/replicated-eventsourcing-auction.html#triggering-closing","text":"In the auction we want to ensure that all bids are seen before declaring a winner.

This reduces the conceptual complexity and can be a handy tool for simple use cases. Very much like a CRUD based operation, the API is conceptually simple - a function from current state and incoming command to the next state which replaces the current state in the database.\n(State, Command) => State\nThe current state is always stored in the database. Since only the latest state is stored, we don’t have access to any of the history of changes, unlike event sourced storage. Pekko Persistence would read that state and store it in memory. After processing of the command is finished, the new state will be stored in the database. The processing of the next command will not start until the state has been successfully stored in the database.\nPekko Persistence also supports Event Sourcing based implementation, where only the events that are persisted by the actor are stored, but not the actual state of the actor. By storing all events, using this model, a stateful actor can be recovered by replaying the stored events to the actor, which allows it to rebuild its state.\nSince each entity lives on one node, consistency is guaranteed and reads can be served directly from memory. For details on how this guarantee is ensured, have a look at the Cluster Sharding and DurableStateBehavior section below.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/typed/durable-state/persistence.html#example-and-core-api","text":"Let’s start with a simple example that models a counter using a Pekko persistent actor.

There are techniques to ensure this uniqueness, an example of which can be found in the Persistence example in the Cluster Sharding documentation. This illustrates how to construct the PersistenceId from the entityTypeKey and entityId provided by the EntityContext.\nThe entityId in Cluster Sharding is the business domain identifier which uniquely identifies the instance of that specific EntityType. This means that across the cluster we have a unique combination of (EntityType, EntityId). Hence the entityId might not be unique enough to be used as the PersistenceId by itself. For example two different types of entities may have the same entityId. To create a unique PersistenceId the entityId should be prefixed with a stable name of the entity type, which typically is the same as the EntityTypeKey.name that is used in Cluster Sharding. There are PersistenceId.applyPersistenceId.of factory methods to help with constructing such PersistenceId from an entityTypeHint and entityId.\nThe default separator when concatenating the entityTypeHint and entityId is |, but a custom separator is supported.\nA custom identifier can be created with PersistenceId.ofUniqueId.","title":"PersistenceId"},{"location":"/typed/durable-state/persistence.html#command-handler","text":"The command handler is a function with 2 parameters, the current State and the incoming Command.\nA command handler returns an Effect directive that defines what state, if any, to persist.

For more complex actors it’s useful to be able to change the behavior in the sense that different functions for processing commands may be defined depending on what state the actor is in.

Regarding data as a stream of elements instead of in its entirety is very useful because it matches the way computers send and receive them (for example via TCP), but it is often also a necessity because data sets frequently become too large to be handled as a whole. We spread computations or analyses over large clusters and call it “big data”, where the whole principle of processing them is by feeding those data sequentially—as a stream—through some CPUs.\nActors can be seen as dealing with streams as well: they send and receive series of messages in order to transfer knowledge (or data) from one place to another. We have found it tedious and error-prone to implement all the proper measures in order to achieve stable streaming between actors, since in addition to sending and receiving we also need to take care to not overflow any buffers or mailboxes in the process. Another pitfall is that Actor messages can be lost and must be retransmitted in that case. Failure to do so would lead to holes at the receiving side.\nFor these reasons we decided to bundle up a solution to these problems as an Pekko Streams API. The purpose is to offer an intuitive and safe way to formulate stream processing setups such that we can then execute them efficiently and with bounded resource usage—no more OutOfMemoryErrors. In order to achieve this our streams need to be able to limit the buffering that they employ, they need to be able to slow down producers if the consumers cannot keep up. This feature is called back-pressure and is at the core of the Reactive Streams initiative of which Pekko is a founding member. For you this means that the hard problem of propagating and reacting to back-pressure has been incorporated in the design of Pekko Streams already, so you have one less thing to worry about; it also means that Pekko Streams interoperate seamlessly with all other Reactive Streams implementations (where Reactive Streams interfaces define the interoperability SPI while implementations like Pekko Streams offer a nice user API).","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"/stream/stream-introduction.html#relationship-with-reactive-streams","text":"The Pekko Streams API is completely decoupled from the Reactive Streams interfaces. While Pekko Streams focus on the formulation of transformations on data streams the scope of Reactive Streams is to define a common mechanism of how to move data across an asynchronous boundary without losses, buffering or resource exhaustion.\nThe relationship between these two is that the Pekko Streams API is geared towards end-users while the Pekko Streams implementation uses the Reactive Streams interfaces internally to pass data between the different operators. For this reason you will not find any resemblance between the Reactive Streams interfaces and the Pekko Streams API. This is in line with the expectations of the Reactive Streams project, whose primary purpose is to define interfaces such that different streaming implementation can interoperate; it is not the purpose of Reactive Streams to describe an end-user API.","title":"Relationship with Reactive Streams"},{"location":"/stream/stream-introduction.html#how-to-read-these-docs","text":"Stream processing is a different paradigm to the Actor Model or to Future composition, therefore it may take some careful study of this subject until you feel familiar with the tools and techniques.

See IDE Tips.","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/stream/stream-quickstart.html#first-steps","text":"A stream usually begins at a source, so this is also how we start a Pekko Stream. Before we create one, we import the full complement of streaming tools:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.stream._\nimport pekko.stream.scaladsl._ Java copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.stream.*;\nimport org.apache.pekko.stream.javadsl.*;\nIf you want to execute the code samples while you read through the quick start guide, you will also need the following imports:\nScala copysourceimport pekko.{ Done, NotUsed }\nimport pekko.actor.ActorSystem\nimport pekko.util.ByteString\nimport scala.concurrent._\nimport scala.concurrent.duration._\nimport java.nio.file.Paths Java copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.Done;\nimport org.apache.pekko.NotUsed;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.ActorSystem;\nimport org.apache.pekko.util.ByteString;\n\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\nimport java.math.BigInteger;\nimport java.time.Duration;\nimport java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage;\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;\nAnd an objecta class to start a Pekko ActorSystemActorSystem and hold your code . Making the ActorSystem implicit makes it available to the streams without manually passing it when running them:\nScala copysourceobject Main extends App {\n  implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem(\"QuickStart\")\n  // Code here\n} Java copysourcepublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] argv) {\n    final ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create(\"QuickStart\");\n    // Code here\n  }\n}\nNow we will start with a rather simple source, emitting the integers 1 to 100:\nScala copysourceval source: Source[Int, NotUsed] = Source(1 to 100) Java copysourcefinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> source = Source.range(1, 100);\nThe SourceSource type is parameterized with two types: the first one is the type of element that this source emits and the second one, the “materialized value”, allows running the source to produce some auxiliary value (e.g. a network source may provide information about the bound port or the peer’s address). Where no auxiliary information is produced, the type NotUsedNotUsed is used. A simple range of integers falls into this category - running our stream produces a NotUsed.\nHaving created this source means that we have a description of how to emit the first 100 natural numbers, but this source is not yet active. In order to get those numbers out we have to run it:\nScala copysourcesource.runForeach(i => println(i)) Java copysourcesource.runForeach(i -> System.out.println(i), system);\nThis line will complement the source with a consumer function—in this example we print out the numbers to the console—and pass this little stream setup to an Actor that runs it. This activation is signaled by having “run” be part of the method name; there are other methods that run Pekko Streams, and they all follow this pattern.\nWhen running this source in a scala.Appprogram you might notice it does not terminate, because the ActorSystemActorSystem is never terminated. Luckily runForeachrunForeach returns a Future[DoneDone]CompletionStage<DoneDone> which resolves when the stream finishes:\nScala copysourceval done: Future[Done] = source.runForeach(i => println(i))\n\nimplicit val ec = system.dispatcher\ndone.onComplete(_ => system.terminate()) Java copysourcefinal CompletionStage<Done> done = source.runForeach(i -> System.out.println(i), system);\n\ndone.thenRun(() -> system.terminate());\nThe nice thing about Pekko Streams is that the Source is a description of what you want to run, and like an architect’s blueprint it can be reused, incorporated into a larger design. We may choose to transform the source of integers and write it to a file instead:\nScala copysourceval factorials = source.scan(BigInt(1))((acc, next) => acc * next)\n\nval result: Future[IOResult] =\n  factorials.map(num => ByteString(s\"$num\\n\")).runWith(FileIO.toPath(Paths.get(\"factorials.txt\"))) Java copysourcefinal Source<BigInteger, NotUsed> factorials =\n    source.scan(BigInteger.ONE, (acc, next) -> acc.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(next)));\n\nfinal CompletionStage<IOResult> result =\n    factorials\n        .map(num -> ByteString.fromString(num.toString() + \"\\n\"))\n        .runWith(FileIO.toPath(Paths.get(\"factorials.txt\")), system);\nFirst we use the scanscan operator to run a computation over the whole stream: starting with the number 1 (BigInt(1)BigInteger.ONE) we multiply by each of the incoming numbers, one after the other; the scan operation emits the initial value and then every calculation result. This yields the series of factorial numbers which we stash away as a Source for later reuse—it is important to keep in mind that nothing is actually computed yet, this is a description of what we want to have computed once we run the stream. Then we convert the resulting series of numbers into a stream of ByteStringByteString objects describing lines in a text file. This stream is then run by attaching a file as the receiver of the data. In the terminology of Pekko Streams this is called a SinkSink. IOResultIOResult is a type that IO operations return in Pekko Streams in order to tell you how many bytes or elements were consumed and whether the stream terminated normally or exceptionally.","title":"First steps"},{"location":"/stream/stream-quickstart.html#browser-embedded-example","text":"Here is another example that you can edit and run in the browser:\nimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.NotUsed\nimport pekko.actor.ActorSystem\nimport pekko.stream.scaladsl._\n\nfinal case class Author(handle: String)\n\nfinal case class Hashtag(name: String)\n\nfinal case class Tweet(author: Author, timestamp: Long, body: String) {\n  def hashtags: Set[Hashtag] =\n    body\n      .split(\" \")\n      .collect {\n        case t if t.startsWith(\"#\") => Hashtag(t.replaceAll(\"[^#\\\\w]\", \"\"))\n      }\n      .toSet\n}\n\nval pekkoTag = Hashtag(\"#pekko\")\n\nval tweets: Source[Tweet, NotUsed] = Source(\n  Tweet(Author(\"rolandkuhn\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#pekko rocks!\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"patriknw\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#pekko !\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"bantonsson\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#pekko !\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"drewhk\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#pekko !\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"ktosopl\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#pekko on the rocks!\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"mmartynas\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"wow #pekko !\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"pekkoteam\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#pekko rocks!\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"bananaman\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#bananas rock!\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"appleman\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"#apples rock!\") ::\n  Tweet(Author(\"drama\"), System.currentTimeMillis, \"we compared #apples to #oranges!\") ::\n  Nil)\n\n  implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem(\"reactive-tweets\")\n\n  tweets\n    .filterNot(_.hashtags.contains(pekkoTag)) // Remove all tweets containing #pekko hashtag\n    .map(_.hashtags) // Get all sets of hashtags ...\n    .reduce(_ ++ _) // ... and reduce them to a single set, removing duplicates across all tweets\n    .mapConcat(identity) // Flatten the set of hashtags to a stream of hashtags\n    .map(_.name.toUpperCase) // Convert all hashtags to upper case\n    .runWith(Sink.foreach(println)) // Attach the Flow to a Sink that will finally print the hashtags","title":"Browser-embedded example"},{"location":"/stream/stream-quickstart.html#reusable-pieces","text":"One of the nice parts of Pekko Streams—and something that other stream libraries do not offer—is that not only sources can be reused like blueprints, all other elements can be as well. We can take the file-writing SinkSink, prepend the processing steps necessary to get the ByteStringByteString elements from incoming strings and package that up as a reusable piece as well. Since the language for writing these streams always flows from left to right (just like plain English), we need a starting point that is like a source but with an “open” input. In Pekko Streams, this is called a FlowFlow:\nScala copysourcedef lineSink(filename: String): Sink[String, Future[IOResult]] =\n  Flow[String].map(s => ByteString(s + \"\\n\")).toMat(FileIO.toPath(Paths.get(filename)))(Keep.right) Java copysourcepublic Sink<String, CompletionStage<IOResult>> lineSink(String filename) {\n  return Flow.of(String.class)\n      .map(s -> ByteString.fromString(s.toString() + \"\\n\"))\n      .toMat(FileIO.toPath(Paths.get(filename)), Keep.right());\n}\nStarting from a flow of strings we convert each to ByteString and then feed to the already known file-writing Sink.

Starting from the factorials source we transform the stream by zipping it together with another stream, represented by a SourceSource that emits the number 0 to 100: the first number emitted by the factorials source is the factorial of zero, the second is the factorial of one, and so on. We combine these two by forming strings like \"3! = 6\".\nScala copysourcefactorials\n  .zipWith(Source(0 to 100))((num, idx) => s\"$idx! = $num\")\n  .throttle(1, 1.second)\n  .runForeach(println) Java copysourcefactorials\n    .zipWith(Source.range(0, 99), (num, idx) -> String.format(\"%d! = %s\", idx, num))\n    .throttle(1, Duration.ofSeconds(1))\n    .runForeach(s -> System.out.println(s), system);\nAll operations so far have been time-independent and could have been performed in the same fashion on strict collections of elements. The next line demonstrates that we are in fact dealing with streams that can flow at a certain speed: we use the throttlethrottle operator to slow down the stream to 1 element per second.\nIf you run this program you will see one line printed per second. One aspect that is not immediately visible deserves mention, though: if you try and set the streams to produce a billion numbers each then you will notice that your JVM does not crash with an OutOfMemoryError, even though you will also notice that running the streams happens in the background, asynchronously (this is the reason for the auxiliary information to be provided as a FutureCompletionStage, in the future). The secret that makes this work is that Pekko Streams implicitly implement pervasive flow control, all operators respect back-pressure. This allows the throttle operator to signal to all its upstream sources of data that it can only accept elements at a certain rate—when the incoming rate is higher than one per second the throttle operator will assert back-pressure upstream.\nThis is all there is to Pekko Streams in a nutshell—glossing over the fact that there are dozens of sources and sinks and many more stream transformation operators to choose from, see also operator index.","title":"Time-Based Processing"},{"location":"/stream/stream-quickstart.html#reactive-tweets","text":"A typical use case for stream processing is consuming a live stream of data that we want to extract or aggregate some other data from.

Traditionally the solution is often to buffer the elements, but this can—and usually will—cause eventual buffer overflows and instability of such systems.

The first type parameter—Tweet in this case—designates the kind of elements produced by the source while the M type parameters describe the object that is created during materialization (see below)—NotUsed (from the scala.runtime package) means that no value is produced, it is the generic equivalent of void.\nThe operations should look familiar to anyone who has used the Scala Collections library, however they operate on streams and not collections of data (which is a very important distinction, as some operations only make sense in streaming and vice versa):\nScala copysourceval authors: Source[Author, NotUsed] =\n  tweets.filter(_.hashtags.contains(pekkoTag)).map(_.author) Java copysourcefinal Source<Author, NotUsed> authors =\n    tweets.filter(t -> t.hashtags().contains(PEKKO)).map(t -> t.author);\nFinally in order to materialize and run the stream computation we need to attach the Flow to a SinkSink<T, M> that will get the Flow running. The simplest way to do this is to call runWith(sink)runWith(sink) on a SourceSource<Out, M>.

One of these that we’ll be using in this example is called BroadcastBroadcast, and it emits elements from its input port to all of its output ports.\nPekko Streams intentionally separate the linear stream structures (Flows) from the non-linear, branching ones (Graphs) in order to offer the most convenient API for both of these cases.

The RunnableGraph can then be run()run() to materialize a stream out of it.\nBoth Graph and RunnableGraph are immutable, thread-safe, and freely shareable.\nA graph can also have one of several other shapes, with one or more unconnected ports. Having unconnected ports expresses a graph that is a partial graph. Concepts around composing and nesting graphs in large structures are explained in detail in Modularity, Composition and Hierarchy.

With Pekko Streams buffering can and must be handled explicitly. For example, if we are only interested in the “most recent tweets, with a buffer of 10 elements” this can be expressed using the bufferbuffer element:\nScala copysourcetweets.buffer(10, OverflowStrategy.dropHead).map(slowComputation).runWith(Sink.ignore) Java copysourcetweets\n    .buffer(10, OverflowStrategy.dropHead())\n    .map(t -> slowComputation(t))\n    .runWith(Sink.ignore(), system);\nThe buffer element takes an explicit and required OverflowStrategyOverflowStrategy, which defines how the buffer should react when it receives another element while it is full.

However sometimes we may be interested in some value that can be obtained from the materialized processing pipeline. For example, we want to know how many tweets we have processed. While this question is not as obvious to give an answer to in case of an infinite stream of tweets (one way to answer this question in a streaming setting would be to create a stream of counts described as “up until now, we’ve processed N tweets”), but in general it is possible to deal with finite streams and come up with a nice result such as a total count of elements.\nFirst, let’s write such an element counter using Sink.fold andFlow.of(Class) and Sink.fold to see how the types look like:\nScala copysourceval count: Flow[Tweet, Int, NotUsed] = Flow[Tweet].map(_ => 1)\n\nval sumSink: Sink[Int, Future[Int]] = Sink.fold[Int, Int](0)(_ + _)\n\nval counterGraph: RunnableGraph[Future[Int]] =\n  tweets.via(count).toMat(sumSink)(Keep.right)\n\nval sum: Future[Int] = counterGraph.run()\n\nsum.foreach(c => println(s\"Total tweets processed: $c\")) Java copysourcefinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Integer>> sumSink =\n    Sink.<Integer, Integer>fold(0, (acc, elem) -> acc + elem);\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<CompletionStage<Integer>> counter =\n    tweets.map(t -> 1).toMat(sumSink, Keep.right());\n\nfinal CompletionStage<Integer> sum = counter.run(system);\n\nsum.thenAcceptAsync(\n    c -> System.out.println(\"Total tweets processed: \" + c), system.dispatcher());\nFirst we prepare a reusable Flow that will change each incoming tweet into an integer of value 1. We’ll use this in order to combine those with a Sink.fold that will sum all Int elements of the stream and make its result available as a Future[Int]. Next we connect the tweets stream to count with via. Finally we connect the Flow to the previously prepared Sink using toMatSink.fold will sum all Integer elements of the stream and make its result available as a CompletionStage<Integer>. Next we use the map method of tweets Source which will change each incoming tweet into an integer value 1. Finally we connect the Flow to the previously prepared Sink using toMat.\nRemember those mysterious Mat type parameters on Source[+Out, +Mat], Flow[-In, +Out, +Mat] and Sink[-In, +Mat]Source<Out, Mat>, Flow<In, Out, Mat> and Sink<In, Mat>? They represent the type of values these processing parts return when materialized. When you chain these together, you can explicitly combine their materialized values. In our example we used the Keep.rightKeep.right() predefined function, which tells the implementation to only care about the materialized type of the operator currently appended to the right. The materialized type of sumSink is Future[Int]CompletionStage and because of using Keep.rightKeep.right(), the resulting RunnableGraphRunnableGraph has also a type parameter of Future[Int]CompletionStage<Integer>.\nThis step does not yet materialize the processing pipeline, it merely prepares the description of the Flow, which is now connected to a Sink, and therefore can be run(), as indicated by its type: RunnableGraph[Future[Int]]RunnableGraph<CompletionStage<Integer>>. Next we call run()run() which materializes and runs the Flow. The value returned by calling run() on a RunnableGraph[T]RunnableGraph<T> is of type T. In our case this type is Future[Int]CompletionStage<Integer> which, when completed, will contain the total length of our tweets stream. In case of the stream failing, this future would complete with a Failure.\nA RunnableGraphRunnableGraph may be reused and materialized multiple times, because it is only the “blueprint” of the stream. This means that if we materialize a stream, for example one that consumes a live stream of tweets within a minute, the materialized values for those two materializations will be different, as illustrated by this example:\nScala copysourceval sumSink = Sink.fold[Int, Int](0)(_ + _)\nval counterRunnableGraph: RunnableGraph[Future[Int]] =\n  tweetsInMinuteFromNow.filter(_.hashtags contains pekkoTag).map(t => 1).toMat(sumSink)(Keep.right)\n\n// materialize the stream once in the morning\nval morningTweetsCount: Future[Int] = counterRunnableGraph.run()\n// and once in the evening, reusing the flow\nval eveningTweetsCount: Future[Int] = counterRunnableGraph.run()\n Java copysourcefinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Integer>> sumSink =\n    Sink.<Integer, Integer>fold(0, (acc, elem) -> acc + elem);\nfinal RunnableGraph<CompletionStage<Integer>> counterRunnableGraph =\n    tweetsInMinuteFromNow\n        .filter(t -> t.hashtags().contains(PEKKO))\n        .map(t -> 1)\n        .toMat(sumSink, Keep.right());\n\n// materialize the stream once in the morning\nfinal CompletionStage<Integer> morningTweetsCount = counterRunnableGraph.run(system);\n// and once in the evening, reusing the blueprint\nfinal CompletionStage<Integer> eveningTweetsCount = counterRunnableGraph.run(system);\nMany elements in Pekko Streams provide materialized values which can be used for obtaining either results of computation or steering these elements which will be discussed in detail in Stream Materialization. Summing up this section, now we know what happens behind the scenes when we run this one-liner, which is equivalent to the multi line version above:\nScala copysourceval sum: Future[Int] = tweets.map(t => 1).runWith(sumSink) Java copysourcefinal CompletionStage<Integer> sum = tweets.map(t -> 1).runWith(sumSink, system);\nNote runWith() is a convenience method that automatically ignores the materialized value of any other operators except those appended by the runWith() itself.

Pekko Streams was designed during the development of Reactive Streams, so they both heavily influenced one another.\nIt may be enlightening to learn that even within the Reactive Specification the types had initially attempted to hide Publisher, Subscriber and the other SPI types from users of the API. Though since those internal SPI types would end up surfacing to end users of the standard in some cases, it was decided to remove the API types, and only keep the SPI types which are the Publisher, Subscriber et al.\nWith this historical knowledge and context about the purpose of the standard – being an internal detail of interoperable libraries - we can with certainty say that it can’t be really said that a direct inheritance relationship with these types can be considered some form of advantage or meaningful differentiator between libraries. Rather, it could be seen that APIs which expose those SPI types to end-users are leaking internal implementation details accidentally.\nThe SourceSource, SinkSink and FlowFlow types which are part of Pekko Streams have the purpose of providing the fluent DSL, as well as to be “factories” for running those streams. Their direct counterparts in Reactive Streams are, respectively, Publisher, Subscriber` and Processor. In other words, Pekko Streams operate on a lifted representation of the computing graph, which then is materialized and executed in accordance to Reactive Streams rules. This also allows Pekko Streams to perform optimizations like fusing and dispatcher configuration during the materialization step.\nAnother not obvious gain from hiding the Reactive Streams interfaces comes from the fact that org.reactivestreams.Subscriber (et al) have now been included in Java 9+, and thus become part of Java itself, so libraries should migrate to using the java.util.concurrent.Flow.Subscriber instead of org.reactivestreams.Subscriber. Libraries which selected to expose and directly extend the Reactive Streams types will now have a tougher time to adapt the JDK9+ types – all their classes that extend Subscriber and friends will need to be copied or changed to extend the exact same interface, but from a different package. In Pekko, we simply expose the new type when asked to – already supporting JDK9 types, from the day JDK9 was released.\nThe other, and perhaps more important reason for hiding the Reactive Streams interfaces comes back to the first points of this explanation: the fact of Reactive Streams being an SPI, and as such is hard to “get right” in ad-hoc implementations. Thus Pekko Streams discourages the use of the hard to implement pieces of the underlying infrastructure, and offers simpler, more type-safe, yet more powerful abstractions for users to work with: GraphStageGraphStages and operators.

As a consequence, the functionality of a library must be expressed such that materialization can be done by the user, outside of the library’s control.\nThe second rule allows a library to additionally provide nice sugar for the common case, an example of which is the Pekko HTTP API that provides a handleWith method for convenient materialization.\nNote One important consequence of this is that a reusable flow description cannot be bound to “live” resources, any connection to or allocation of such resources must be deferred until materialization time.

Always keep in mind that the Reactive Streams interfaces (Publisher/Subscription/Subscriber) are modeling the low-level infrastructure for passing streams between execution units, and errors on this level are precisely the failures that we are talking about on the higher level that is modeled by Pekko Streams.\nThere is only limited support for treating onError in Pekko Streams compared to the operators that are available for the transformation of data elements, which is intentional in the spirit of the previous paragraph. Since onError signals that the stream is collapsing, its ordering semantics are not the same as for stream completion: transformation operators of any kind will collapse with the stream, possibly still holding elements in implicit or explicit buffers. This means that data elements emitted before a failure can still be lost if the onError overtakes them.\nThe ability for failures to propagate faster than data elements is essential for tearing down streams that are back-pressured—especially since back-pressure can be the failure mode (e.g. by tripping upstream buffers which then abort because they cannot do anything else; or if a dead-lock occurred).","title":"The difference between Error and Failure"},{"location":"/general/stream/stream-design.html#the-semantics-of-stream-recovery","text":"A recovery element (i.e. any transformation that absorbs an onError signal and turns that into possibly more data elements followed normal stream completion) acts as a bulkhead that confines a stream collapse to a given region of the stream topology.

This latter property is what we refer to as boundedness, and it is the defining feature of Pekko Streams. Translated to everyday terms, it is possible to express a chain (or as we see later, graphs) of processing entities. Each of these entities executes independently (and possibly concurrently) from the others while only buffering a limited number of elements at any given time. This property of bounded buffers is one of the differences from the actor model, where each actor usually has an unbounded, or a bounded, but dropping mailbox. Pekko Stream processing entities have bounded “mailboxes” that do not drop.\nBefore we move on, let’s define some basic terminology which will be used throughout the entire documentation:\nStream An active process that involves moving and transforming data. Element An element is the processing unit of streams. All operations transform and transfer elements from upstream to downstream. Buffer sizes are always expressed as number of elements independently from the actual size of the elements. Back-pressure A means of flow-control, a way for consumers of data to notify a producer about their current availability, effectively slowing down the upstream producer to match their consumption speeds. In the context of Pekko Streams back-pressure is always understood as non-blocking and asynchronous. Non-Blocking Means that a certain operation does not hinder the progress of the calling thread, even if it takes a long time to finish the requested operation. Graph A description of a stream processing topology, defining the pathways through which elements shall flow when the stream is running. Operator The common name for all building blocks that build up a Graph. Examples of operators are map(), filter(), custom ones extending GraphStages and graph junctions like Merge or Broadcast. For the full list of built-in operators see the operator index\nWhen we talk about asynchronous, non-blocking backpressure, we mean that the operators available in Pekko Streams will not use blocking calls but asynchronous message passing to exchange messages between each other. This way they can slow down a fast producer without blocking its thread. This is a thread-pool friendly design, since entities that need to wait (a fast producer waiting on a slow consumer) will not block the thread but can hand it back for further use to an underlying thread-pool.","title":"Core concepts"},{"location":"/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html#defining-and-running-streams","text":"Linear processing pipelines can be expressed in Pekko Streams using the following core abstractions:\nSource An operator with exactly one output, emitting data elements whenever downstream operators are ready to receive them. Sink An operator with exactly one input, requesting and accepting data elements, possibly slowing down the upstream producer of elements. Flow An operator which has exactly one input and output, which connects its upstream and downstream by transforming the data elements flowing through it. RunnableGraph A Flow that has both ends “attached” to a Source and Sink respectively, and is ready to be run().\nIt is possible to attach a FlowFlow to a SourceSource resulting in a composite source, and it is also possible to prepend a Flow to a SinkSink to get a new sink. After a stream is properly constructed by having both a source and a sink, it will be represented by the RunnableGraphRunnableGraph type, indicating that it is ready to be executed.\nIt is important to remember that even after constructing the RunnableGraph by connecting all the source, sink and different operators, no data will flow through it until it is materialized. Materialization is the process of allocating all resources needed to run the computation described by a Graph (in Pekko Streams this will often involve starting up Actors). Thanks to Flows being a description of the processing pipeline they are immutable, thread-safe, and freely shareable, which means that it is for example safe to share and send them between actors, to have one actor prepare the work, and then have it be materialized at some completely different place in the code.\nScala copysourceval source = Source(1 to 10)\nval sink = Sink.fold[Int, Int](0)(_ + _)\n\n// connect the Source to the Sink, obtaining a RunnableGraph\nval runnable: RunnableGraph[Future[Int]] = source.toMat(sink)(Keep.right)\n\n// materialize the flow and get the value of the sink\nval sum: Future[Int] = runnable.run()\n Java copysourcefinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> source =\n    Source.from(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10));\n// note that the Future is scala.concurrent.Future\nfinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Integer>> sink = Sink.fold(0, Integer::sum);\n\n// connect the Source to the Sink, obtaining a RunnableFlow\nfinal RunnableGraph<CompletionStage<Integer>> runnable = source.toMat(sink, Keep.right());\n\n// materialize the flow\nfinal CompletionStage<Integer> sum = runnable.run(system);\nAfter running (materializing) the RunnableGraph[T] we get back the materialized value of type T. Every stream operator can produce a materialized value, and it is the responsibility of the user to combine them to a new type. In the above example, we used toMat to indicate that we want to transform the materialized value of the source and sink, and we used the convenience function Keep.right to say that we are only interested in the materialized value of the sink. In our example, the Sink.fold materializes a value of type Future which will represent the result of the folding process over the stream. In general, a stream can expose multiple materialized values, but it is quite common to be interested in only the value of the Source or the Sink in the stream. For this reason there is a convenience method called runWith() available for Sink, Source or Flow requiring, respectively, a supplied Source (in order to run a Sink), a Sink (in order to run a Source) or both a Source and a Sink (in order to run a Flow, since it has neither attached yet).\nAfter running (materializing) the RunnableGraph we get a special container object, the MaterializedMap. Both sources and sinks are able to put specific objects into this map. Whether they put something in or not is implementation dependent. For example, a Sink.fold will make a CompletionStage available in this map which will represent the result of the folding process over the stream. In general, a stream can expose multiple materialized values, but it is quite common to be interested in only the value of the Source or the Sink in the stream. For this reason there is a convenience method called runWith() available for Sink, Source or Flow requiring, respectively, a supplied Source (in order to run a Sink), a Sink (in order to run a Source) or both a Source and a Sink (in order to run a Flow, since it has neither attached yet).\nScala copysourceval source = Source(1 to 10)\nval sink = Sink.fold[Int, Int](0)(_ + _)\n\n// materialize the flow, getting the Sink's materialized value\nval sum: Future[Int] = source.runWith(sink) Java copysourcefinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> source =\n    Source.from(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10));\nfinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Integer>> sink = Sink.fold(0, Integer::sum);\n\n// materialize the flow, getting the Sink's materialized value\nfinal CompletionStage<Integer> sum = source.runWith(sink, system);\nIt is worth pointing out that since operators are immutable, connecting them returns a new operator, instead of modifying the existing instance, so while constructing long flows, remember to assign the new value to a variable or run it:\nScala copysourceval source = Source(1 to 10)\nsource.map(_ => 0) // has no effect on source, since it's immutable\nsource.runWith(Sink.fold(0)(_ + _)) // 55\n\nval zeroes = source.map(_ => 0) // returns new Source[Int], with `map()` appended\nzeroes.runWith(Sink.fold(0)(_ + _)) // 0 Java copysourcefinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> source =\n    Source.from(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10));\nsource.map(x -> 0); // has no effect on source, since it's immutable\nsource.runWith(Sink.fold(0, Integer::sum), system); // 55\n\n// returns new Source<Integer>, with `map()` appended\nfinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> zeroes = source.map(x -> 0);\nfinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Integer>> fold = Sink.fold(0, Integer::sum);\nzeroes.runWith(fold, system); // 0\nNote By default, Pekko Streams elements support exactly one downstream operator. Making fan-out (supporting multiple downstream operators) an explicit opt-in feature allows default stream elements to be less complex and more efficient. Also, it allows for greater flexibility on how exactly to handle the multicast scenarios, by providing named fan-out elements such as broadcast (signals all down-stream elements) or balance (signals one of available down-stream elements).\nIn the above example we used the runWith method, which both materializes the stream and returns the materialized value of the given sink or source.\nSince a stream can be materialized multiple times, the materialized value will also be calculated anew MaterializedMap returned is different for each such materialization, usually leading to different values being returned each time. In the example below, we create two running materialized instances of the stream that we described in the runnable variable. Both materializations give us a different FutureCompletionStage from the map even though we used the same sink to refer to the future:\nScala copysource// connect the Source to the Sink, obtaining a RunnableGraph\nval sink = Sink.fold[Int, Int](0)(_ + _)\nval runnable: RunnableGraph[Future[Int]] =\n  Source(1 to 10).toMat(sink)(Keep.right)\n\n// get the materialized value of the sink\nval sum1: Future[Int] = runnable.run()\nval sum2: Future[Int] = runnable.run()\n\n// sum1 and sum2 are different Futures!

It is possible however to add explicit buffer operators with overflow strategies that can influence the behavior of the stream. This is especially important in complex processing graphs which may even contain loops (which must be treated with very special care, as explained in Graph cycles, liveness and deadlocks).\nThe back pressure protocol is defined in terms of the number of elements a downstream Subscriber is able to receive and buffer, referred to as demand. The source of data, referred to as Publisher in Reactive Streams terminology and implemented as SourceSource in Pekko Streams, guarantees that it will never emit more elements than the received total demand for any given Subscriber.\nNote The Reactive Streams specification defines its protocol in terms of Publisher and Subscriber. These types are not meant to be user facing API, instead they serve as the low-level building blocks for different Reactive Streams implementations. Pekko Streams implements these concepts as SourceSource, FlowFlow (referred to as Processor in Reactive Streams) and SinkSink without exposing the Reactive Streams interfaces directly. If you need to integrate with other Reactive Stream libraries, read Integrating with Reactive Streams.\nThe mode in which Reactive Streams back-pressure works can be colloquially described as “dynamic push / pull mode”, since it will switch between push and pull based back-pressure models depending on the downstream being able to cope with the upstream production rate or not.\nTo illustrate this further let us consider both problem situations and how the back-pressure protocol handles them:","title":"Back-pressure explained"},{"location":"/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html#slow-publisher-fast-subscriber","text":"This is the happy case – we do not need to slow down the Publisher in this case. However signalling rates are rarely constant and could change at any point in time, suddenly ending up in a situation where the Subscriber is now slower than the Publisher. In order to safeguard from these situations, the back-pressure protocol must still be enabled during such situations, however we do not want to pay a high penalty for this safety net being enabled.\nThe Reactive Streams protocol solves this by asynchronously signalling from the Subscriber to the Publisher Request(n:Int) Request(int n) signals. The protocol guarantees that the Publisher will never signal more elements than the signalled demand. Since the Subscriber however is currently faster, it will be signalling these Request messages at a higher rate (and possibly also batching together the demand - requesting multiple elements in one Request signal). This means that the Publisher should not ever have to wait (be back-pressured) with publishing its incoming elements.\nAs we can see, in this scenario we effectively operate in so called push-mode since the Publisher can continue producing elements as fast as it can, since the pending demand will be recovered just-in-time while it is emitting elements.","title":"Slow Publisher, fast Subscriber"},{"location":"/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html#fast-publisher-slow-subscriber","text":"This is the case when back-pressuring the Publisher is required, because the Subscriber is not able to cope with the rate at which its upstream would like to emit data elements.\nSince the Publisher is not allowed to signal more elements than the pending demand signalled by the Subscriber, it will have to abide to this back-pressure by applying one of the below strategies:\nnot generate elements, if it is able to control their production rate, try buffering the elements in a bounded manner until more demand is signalled, drop elements until more demand is signalled, tear down the stream if unable to apply any of the above strategies.\nAs we can see, this scenario effectively means that the Subscriber will pull the elements from the Publisher – this mode of operation is referred to as pull-based back-pressure.","title":"Fast Publisher, slow Subscriber"},{"location":"/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html#stream-materialization","text":"When constructing flows and graphs in Pekko Streams think of them as preparing a blueprint, an execution plan.

In the case of Pekko Streams this often means starting up Actors which power the processing, but is not restricted to that—it could also mean opening files or socket connections etc.—depending on what the stream needs.\nMaterialization is triggered at so called “terminal operations”. Most notably this includes the various forms of the run() and runWith() methods defined on SourceSource and FlowFlow elements as well as a small number of special syntactic sugars for running with well-known sinks, such as runForeach(el => ...)runForeach(el -> ...) (being an alias to runWith(Sink.foreach(el => ...))runWith(Sink.foreach(el -> ...))).\nMaterialization is performed synchronously on the materializing thread by an ActorSystemActorSystem global MaterializerMaterializer.

This means that the processing steps of a flow or stream can be executed within the same Actor and has two consequences:\npassing elements from one operator to the next is a lot faster between fused operators due to avoiding the asynchronous messaging overhead fused stream operators do not run in parallel to each other, meaning that only up to one CPU core is used for each fused part\nTo allow for parallel processing you will have to insert asynchronous boundaries manually into your flows and operators by way of adding Attributes.asyncBoundaryAttributes.asyncBoundary using the method async on SourceSource, SinkSink and FlowFlow to operators that shall communicate with the downstream of the graph in an asynchronous fashion.\nScala copysourceSource(List(1, 2, 3)).map(_ + 1).async.map(_ * 2).to(Sink.ignore) Java copysourceSource.range(1, 3).map(x -> x + 1).async().map(x -> x * 2).to(Sink.ignore());\nIn this example we create two regions within the flow which will be executed in one Actor each—assuming that adding and multiplying integers is an extremely costly operation this will lead to a performance gain since two CPUs can work on the tasks in parallel. It is important to note that asynchronous boundaries are not singular places within a flow where elements are passed asynchronously (as in other streaming libraries), but instead attributes always work by adding information to the flow graph that has been constructed up to this point:\nThis means that everything that is inside the red bubble will be executed by one actor and everything outside of it by another. This scheme can be applied successively, always having one such boundary enclose the previous ones plus all operators that have been added since then.\nWarning Without fusing (i.e. up to version 2.0-M2) each stream operator had an implicit input buffer that holds a few elements for efficiency reasons. If your flow graphs contain cycles then these buffers may have been crucial in order to avoid deadlocks. With fusing these implicit buffers are no longer there, data elements are passed without buffering between fused operators.

Note that this can be materialized multiple times.\nScala copysourceval completeWithDone: PartialFunction[Any, CompletionStrategy] = { case Done => CompletionStrategy.immediately }\nval matValuePoweredSource =\n  Source.actorRef[String](\n    completionMatcher = completeWithDone,\n    failureMatcher = PartialFunction.empty,\n    bufferSize = 100,\n    overflowStrategy = OverflowStrategy.fail)\n\nval (actorRef, source) = matValuePoweredSource.preMaterialize()\n\nactorRef ! \"Hello!\"\n\n// pass source around for materialization\nsource.runWith(Sink.foreach(println)) Java copysourceSource<String, ActorRef> matValuePoweredSource =\n    Source.actorRef(\n        elem -> {\n          // complete stream immediately if we send it Done\n          if (elem == Done.done()) return Optional.of(CompletionStrategy.immediately());\n          else return Optional.empty();\n        },\n        // never fail the stream because of a message\n        elem -> Optional.empty(),\n        100,\n        OverflowStrategy.fail());\n\nPair<ActorRef, Source<String, NotUsed>> actorRefSourcePair =\n    matValuePoweredSource.preMaterialize(system);\n\nactorRefSourcePair.first().tell(\"Hello!\", ActorRef.noSender());\n\n// pass source around for materialization\nactorRefSourcePair.second().runWith(Sink.foreach(System.out::println), system);","title":"Source pre-materialization"},{"location":"/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html#stream-ordering","text":"In Pekko Streams, almost all computation operators preserve input order of elements. This means that if inputs {IA1,IA2,...,IAn} “cause” outputs {OA1,OA2,...,OAk} and inputs {IB1,IB2,...,IBm} “cause” outputs {OB1,OB2,...,OBl} and all of IAi happened before all IBi then OAi happens before OBi.\nThis property is even upheld by async operations such as mapAsyncmapAsync, however an unordered version exists called mapAsyncUnorderedmapAsyncUnordered which does not preserve this ordering.\nHowever, in the case of Junctions which handle multiple input streams (e.g. Merge) the output order is, in general, not defined for elements arriving on different input ports. That is a merge-like operation may emit Ai before emitting Bi, and it is up to its internal logic to decide the order of emitted elements. Specialized elements such as Zip however do guarantee their outputs order, as each output element depends on all upstream elements having been signalled already – thus the ordering in the case of zipping is defined by this property.\nIf you find yourself in need of fine grained control over order of emitted elements in fan-in scenarios consider using MergePreferred, MergePrioritized or GraphStage – which gives you full control over how the merge is performed.","title":"Stream ordering"},{"location":"/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html#actor-materializer-lifecycle","text":"The MaterializerMaterializer is a component that is responsible for turning the stream blueprint into a running stream and emitting the “materialized value”. An ActorSystemActorSystem wide Materializer is provided by the Pekko Extension SystemMaterializerSystemMaterializer by having an implicit ActorSystem in scopepassing the ActorSystem to the various run methods this way there is no need to worry about the Materializer unless there are special requirements.\nThe use case that may require a custom instance of Materializer is when all streams materialized in an actor should be tied to the Actor lifecycle and stop if the Actor stops or crashes.\nAn important aspect of working with streams and actors is understanding a Materializer’s life-cycle. The materializer is bound to the lifecycle of the ActorRefFactoryActorRefFactory it is created from, which in practice will be either an ActorSystemActorSystem or ActorContextActorContext (when the materializer is created within an ActorActor).\nTying it to the ActorSystem should be replaced with using the system materializer from Pekko 2.6 and on.\nWhen run by the system materializer the streams will run until the ActorSystem is shut down. When the materializer is shut down before the streams have run to completion, they will be terminated abruptly. This is a little different than the usual way to terminate streams, which is by cancelling/completing them. The stream lifecycles are bound to the materializer like this to prevent leaks, and in normal operations you should not rely on the mechanism and rather use KillSwitchKillSwitch or normal completion signals to manage the lifecycles of your streams.\nIf we look at the following example, where we create the Materializer within an Actor:\nScala copysourcefinal class RunWithMyself extends Actor {\n  implicit val mat: Materializer = Materializer(context)\n\n  Source.maybe.runWith(Sink.onComplete {\n    case Success(done) => println(s\"Completed: $done\")\n    case Failure(ex)   => println(s\"Failed: ${ex.getMessage}\")\n  })\n\n  def receive = {\n    case \"boom\" =>\n      context.stop(self) // will also terminate the stream\n  }\n} Java copysourcefinal class RunWithMyself extends AbstractActor {\n\n  Materializer mat = Materializer.createMaterializer(context());\n\n  @Override\n  public void preStart() throws Exception {\n    Source.repeat(\"hello\")\n        .runWith(\n            Sink.onComplete(\n                tryDone -> {\n                  System.out.println(\"Terminated stream: \" + tryDone);\n                }),\n            mat);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(\n            String.class,\n            p -> {\n              // this WILL terminate the above stream as well\n              context().stop(self());\n            })\n        .build();\n  }\n}\nIn the above example we used the ActorContextActorContext to create the materializer. This binds its lifecycle to the surrounding ActorActor. In other words, while the stream we started there would under normal circumstances run forever, if we stop the Actor it would terminate the stream as well. We have bound the stream’s lifecycle to the surrounding actor’s lifecycle. This is a very useful technique if the stream is closely related to the actor, e.g. when the actor represents a user or other entity, that we continuously query using the created stream – and it would not make sense to keep the stream alive when the actor has terminated already. The streams termination will be signalled by an “Abrupt termination exception” signaled by the stream.\nYou may also cause a Materializer to shut down by explicitly calling shutdown()shutdown() on it, resulting in abruptly terminating all of the streams it has been running then.\nSometimes, however, you may want to explicitly create a stream that will out-last the actor’s life. For example, you are using a Pekko stream to push some large stream of data to an external service. You may want to eagerly stop the Actor since it has performed all of its duties already:\nScala copysourcefinal class RunForever(implicit val mat: Materializer) extends Actor {\n\n  Source.maybe.runWith(Sink.onComplete {\n    case Success(done) => println(s\"Completed: $done\")\n    case Failure(ex)   => println(s\"Failed: ${ex.getMessage}\")\n  })\n\n  def receive = {\n    case \"boom\" =>\n      context.stop(self) // will NOT terminate the stream (it's bound to the system!)\n  }\n} Java copysourcefinal class RunForever extends AbstractActor {\n\n  private final Materializer materializer;\n\n  public RunForever(Materializer materializer) {\n    this.materializer = materializer;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void preStart() throws Exception {\n    Source.repeat(\"hello\")\n        .runWith(\n            Sink.onComplete(\n                tryDone -> {\n                  System.out.println(\"Terminated stream: \" + tryDone);\n                }),\n            materializer);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(\n            String.class,\n            p -> {\n              // will NOT terminate the stream (it's bound to the system!)\n              context().stop(self());\n            })\n        .build();\n  }\nIn the above example we pass in a materializer to the Actor, which results in binding its lifecycle to the entire ActorSystemActorSystem rather than the single enclosing actor. This can be useful if you want to share a materializer or group streams into specific materializers, for example because of the materializer’s settings etc.\nWarning Do not create new actor materializers inside actors by passing the context.systemcontext.system() to it. This will cause a new MaterializerMaterializer to be created and potentially leaked (unless you shut it down explicitly) for each such actor. It is instead recommended to either pass-in the Materializer or create one using the actor’s context.","title":"Actor Materializer Lifecycle"},{"location":"/stream/stream-graphs.html","text":"","title":"Working with Graphs"},{"location":"/stream/stream-graphs.html#working-with-graphs","text":"","title":"Working with Graphs"},{"location":"/stream/stream-graphs.html#dependency","text":"To use Pekko Streams, add the module to your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-stream\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-stream_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-stream_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/stream/stream-graphs.html#introduction","text":"In Pekko Streams, computation graphs are not expressed using a fluent DSL like linear computations are, instead they are written in a more graph-resembling DSL which aims to make translating graph drawings (e.g. from notes taken from design discussions, or illustrations in protocol specifications) to and from code simpler. In this section we’ll dive into the multiple ways of constructing and re-using graphs, as well as explain common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\nGraphs are needed whenever you want to perform any kind of fan-in (“multiple inputs”) or fan-out (“multiple outputs”) operations. Considering linear Flows to be like roads, we can picture graph operations as junctions: multiple flows being connected at a single point. Some operators which are common enough and fit the linear style of Flows, such as concat (which concatenates two streams, such that the second one is consumed after the first one has completed), may have shorthand methods defined on Flow or Source themselves, however you should keep in mind that those are also implemented as graph junctions.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/stream/stream-graphs.html#constructing-graphs","text":"Graphs are built from simple Flows which serve as the linear connections within the graphs as well as junctions which serve as fan-in and fan-out points for Flows. Thanks to the junctions having meaningful types based on their behavior and making them explicit elements these elements should be rather straightforward to use.\nPekko Streams currently provide these junctions (for a detailed list see the operator index):\nFan-out Broadcast[T]Broadcast<T> – (1 input, N outputs) given an input element emits to each output Balance[T]Balance<T> – (1 input, N outputs) given an input element emits to one of its output ports UnzipWith[In,A,B,...]UnzipWith<In,A,B,...> – (1 input, N outputs) takes a function of 1 input that given a value for each input emits N output elements (where N <= 20) UnZip[A,B]UnZip<A,B> – (1 input, 2 outputs) splits a stream of (A,B)Pair<A,B> tuples into two streams, one of type A and one of type B Fan-in Merge[In]Merge<In> – (N inputs , 1 output) picks randomly from inputs pushing them one by one to its output MergePreferred[In]MergePreferred<In> – like Merge but if elements are available on preferred port, it picks from it, otherwise randomly from others MergePrioritized[In]MergePrioritized<In> – like Merge but if elements are available on all input ports, it picks from them randomly based on their priority MergeLatest[In]MergeLatest<In> – (N inputs, 1 output) emits List[In], when i-th input stream emits element, then i-th element in emitted list is updated MergeSequence[In]MergeSequence<In> – (N inputs, 1 output) emits List[In], where the input streams must represent a partitioned sequence that must be merged back together in order ZipWith[A,B,...,Out]ZipWith<A,B,...,Out> – (N inputs, 1 output) which takes a function of N inputs that given a value for each input emits 1 output element Zip[A,B]Zip<A,B> – (2 inputs, 1 output) is a ZipWith specialised to zipping input streams of A and B into a (A,B)Pair(A,B) tuple stream Concat[A]Concat<A> – (2 inputs, 1 output) concatenates two streams (first consume one, then the second one)\nOne of the goals of the GraphDSL DSL is to look similar to how one would draw a graph on a whiteboard, so that it is simple to translate a design from whiteboard to code and be able to relate those two. Let’s illustrate this by translating the below hand drawn graph into Pekko Streams:\nSuch a graph is simple to translate to the Graph DSL since each linear element corresponds to a Flow, and each circle corresponds to either a Junction or a Source or Sink if it is beginning or ending a Flow. Junctions must always be created with defined type parameters, as otherwise the Nothing type will be inferred.\nScala copysourceval g = RunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder: GraphDSL.Builder[NotUsed] =>\n  import GraphDSL.Implicits._\n  val in = Source(1 to 10)\n  val out = Sink.ignore\n\n  val bcast = builder.add(Broadcast[Int](2))\n  val merge = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n\n  val f1, f2, f3, f4 = Flow[Int].map(_ + 10)\n\n  in ~> f1 ~> bcast ~> f2 ~> merge ~> f3 ~> out\n  bcast ~> f4 ~> merge\n  ClosedShape\n}) Java copysourcefinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> in = Source.from(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));\nfinal Sink<List<String>, CompletionStage<List<String>>> sink = Sink.head();\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> f1 = Flow.of(Integer.class).map(elem -> elem + 10);\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> f2 = Flow.of(Integer.class).map(elem -> elem + 20);\nfinal Flow<Integer, String, NotUsed> f3 = Flow.of(Integer.class).map(elem -> elem.toString());\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> f4 = Flow.of(Integer.class).map(elem -> elem + 30);\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<CompletionStage<List<String>>> result =\n    RunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL // create() function binds sink, out which is sink's out port and builder DSL\n            .create( // we need to reference out's shape in the builder DSL below (in to()\n            // function)\n            sink, // previously created sink (Sink)\n            (builder, out) -> { // variables: builder (GraphDSL.Builder) and out (SinkShape)\n              final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> bcast =\n                  builder.add(Broadcast.create(2));\n              final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> merge = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n\n              final Outlet<Integer> source = builder.add(in).out();\n              builder\n                  .from(source)\n                  .via(builder.add(f1))\n                  .viaFanOut(bcast)\n                  .via(builder.add(f2))\n                  .viaFanIn(merge)\n                  .via(builder.add(f3.grouped(1000)))\n                  .to(out); // to() expects a SinkShape\n              builder.from(bcast).via(builder.add(f4)).toFanIn(merge);\n              return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n            }));\nNote Junction reference equality defines graph node equality (i.e. the same merge instance used in a GraphDSL refers to the same location in the resulting graph).\nNotice the import GraphDSL.Implicits._ which brings into scope the ~> operator (read as “edge”, “via” or “to”) and its inverted counterpart <~ (for noting down flows in the opposite direction where appropriate).\nBy looking at the snippets above, it should be apparent that the GraphDSL.Builderbuilder object is mutable. It is used (implicitly) by the ~> operator, also making it a mutable operation as well. The reason for this design choice is to enable simpler creation of complex graphs, which may even contain cycles. Once the GraphDSL has been constructed though, the GraphDSLRunnableGraph instance is immutable, thread-safe, and freely shareable. The same is true of all operators—sources, sinks, and flows—once they are constructed. This means that you can safely re-use one given Flow or junction in multiple places in a processing graph.\nWe have seen examples of such re-use already above: the merge and broadcast junctions were imported into the graph using builder.add(...), an operation that will make a copy of the blueprint that is passed to it and return the inlets and outlets of the resulting copy so that they can be wired up. Another alternative is to pass existing graphs—of any shape—into the factory method that produces a new graph. The difference between these approaches is that importing using builder.add(...) ignores the materialized value of the imported graph while importing via the factory method allows its inclusion; for more details see Stream Materialization.\nIn the example below, we prepare a graph that consists of two parallel streams, in which we re-use the same instance of Flow, yet it will properly be materialized as two connections between the corresponding Sources and Sinks:\nScala copysource val topHeadSink = Sink.head[Int]\nval bottomHeadSink = Sink.head[Int]\nval sharedDoubler = Flow[Int].map(_ * 2)\n\nRunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.createGraph(topHeadSink, bottomHeadSink)((_, _)) { implicit builder =>\n  (topHS, bottomHS) =>\n  import GraphDSL.Implicits._\n  val broadcast = builder.add(Broadcast[Int](2))\n  Source.single(1) ~> broadcast.in\n\n  broadcast ~> sharedDoubler ~> topHS.in\n  broadcast ~> sharedDoubler ~> bottomHS.in\n  ClosedShape\n}) Java copysourcefinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Integer>> topHeadSink = Sink.head();\nfinal Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Integer>> bottomHeadSink = Sink.head();\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> sharedDoubler =\n    Flow.of(Integer.class).map(elem -> elem * 2);\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<Pair<CompletionStage<Integer>, CompletionStage<Integer>>> g =\n    RunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            topHeadSink, // import this sink into the graph\n            bottomHeadSink, // and this as well\n            Keep.both(),\n            (b, top, bottom) -> {\n              final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> bcast = b.add(Broadcast.create(2));\n\n              b.from(b.add(Source.single(1)))\n                  .viaFanOut(bcast)\n                  .via(b.add(sharedDoubler))\n                  .to(top);\n              b.from(bcast).via(b.add(sharedDoubler)).to(bottom);\n              return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n            }));\nIn some cases we may have a list of graph elements, for example, if they are dynamically created. If these graphs have similar signatures, we can construct a graph collecting all their materialized values as a collection:\nScala copysourceval sinks = immutable\n  .Seq(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n  .map(prefix => Flow[String].filter(str => str.startsWith(prefix)).toMat(Sink.head[String])(Keep.right))\n\nval g: RunnableGraph[Seq[Future[String]]] = RunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create(sinks) {\n  implicit b => sinkList =>\n    import GraphDSL.Implicits._\n    val broadcast = b.add(Broadcast[String](sinkList.size))\n\n    Source(List(\"ax\", \"bx\", \"cx\")) ~> broadcast\n    sinkList.foreach(sink => broadcast ~> sink)\n\n    ClosedShape\n})\n\nval matList: Seq[Future[String]] = g.run() Java copysource// create the source\nfinal Source<String, NotUsed> in = Source.from(Arrays.asList(\"ax\", \"bx\", \"cx\"));\n// generate the sinks from code\nList<String> prefixes = Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\");\nfinal List<Sink<String, CompletionStage<String>>> list = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (String prefix : prefixes) {\n  final Sink<String, CompletionStage<String>> sink =\n      Flow.of(String.class)\n          .filter(str -> str.startsWith(prefix))\n          .toMat(Sink.head(), Keep.right());\n  list.add(sink);\n}\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<List<CompletionStage<String>>> g =\n    RunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            list,\n            (GraphDSL.Builder<List<CompletionStage<String>>> builder,\n                List<SinkShape<String>> outs) -> {\n              final UniformFanOutShape<String, String> bcast =\n                  builder.add(Broadcast.create(outs.size()));\n\n              final Outlet<String> source = builder.add(in).out();\n              builder.from(source).viaFanOut(bcast);\n\n              for (SinkShape<String> sink : outs) {\n                builder.from(bcast).to(sink);\n              }\n\n              return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n            }));\nList<CompletionStage<String>> result = g.run(system);","title":"Constructing Graphs"},{"location":"/stream/stream-graphs.html#constructing-and-combining-partial-graphs","text":"Sometimes, it is not possible (or needed) to construct the entire computation graph in one place, but instead construct all of its different phases in different places and in the end connect them all into a complete graph and run it.\nThis can be achieved by returning a different Shape than ClosedShape, for example FlowShape(in, out), from the function given to GraphDSL.create.

Making a Graph a RunnableGraphusing the returned Graph from GraphDSL.create() rather than passing it to RunnableGraph.fromGraph() to wrap it in a RunnableGraph.The reason of representing it as a different type is that a RunnableGraph requires all ports to be connected, and if they are not it will throw an exception at construction time, which helps to avoid simple wiring errors while working with graphs.

The graph can then be run and yields the expected result.\nWarning Please note that GraphDSL is not able to provide compile time type-safety about whether or not all elements have been properly connected—this validation is performed as a runtime check during the graph’s instantiation. A partial graph also verifies that all ports are either connected or part of the returned Shape.","title":"Constructing and combining Partial Graphs"},{"location":"/stream/stream-graphs.html#constructing-sources-sinks-and-flows-from-partial-graphs","text":"Instead of treating a partial graphGraph as a collection of flows and junctions which may not yet all be connected it is sometimes useful to expose such a complex graph as a simpler structure, such as a Source, Sink or Flow.\nIn fact, these concepts can be expressed as special cases of a partially connected graph:\nSource is a partial graph with exactly one output, that is it returns a SourceShape. Sink is a partial graph with exactly one input, that is it returns a SinkShape. Flow is a partial graph with exactly one input and exactly one output, that is it returns a FlowShape.\nBeing able to hide complex graphs inside of simple elements such as Sink / Source / Flow enables you to create one complex element and from there on treat it as simple compound operator for linear computations.\nIn order to create a Source from a graph the method Source.fromGraph is used, to use it we must have a Graph[SourceShape, T]Graph with a SourceShape. This is constructed using GraphDSL.create and returning a SourceShape from the function passed inGraphDSL.create and providing building a SourceShape graph.

Our reusable worker pool junction will not preserve the order of the incoming jobs (they are assumed to have a proper ID field) and it will use a Balance junction to schedule jobs to available workers. On top of this, our junction will feature a “fastlane”, a dedicated port where jobs of higher priority can be sent.\nAltogether, our junction will have two input ports of type I (for the normal and priority jobs) and an output port of type O. To represent this interface, we need to define a custom Shape.

First, we will merge incoming normal and priority jobs using MergePreferred, then we will send the jobs to a Balance junction which will fan-out to a configurable number of workers (flows), finally we merge all these results together and send them out through our only output port.

Source variable is not defined as the nature and number of element does not matter for described problems.\nThe first example demonstrates a graph that contains a naïve cycle. The graph takes elements from the source, prints them, then broadcasts those elements to a consumer (we just used Sink.ignore for now) and to a feedback arc that is merged back into the main stream via a Merge junction.\nNote The graph DSL allows the connection arrows to be reversed, which is particularly handy when writing cycles—as we will see there are cases where this is very helpful.\nScala copysource// WARNING!

After some investigation we observe that:\nthrough merging from source we increase the number of elements flowing in the cycle by broadcasting back to the cycle we do not decrease the number of elements in the cycle\nSince Pekko Streams (and Reactive Streams in general) guarantee bounded processing (see the “Buffering” section for more details) it means that only a bounded number of elements are buffered over any time span. Since our cycle gains more and more elements, eventually all of its internal buffers become full, backpressuring source forever. To be able to process more elements from source elements would need to leave the cycle somehow.\nIf we modify our feedback loop by replacing the Merge junction with a MergePreferred we can avoid the deadlock. MergePreferred is unfair as it always tries to consume from a preferred input port if there are elements available before trying the other lower priority input ports. Since we feed back through the preferred port it is always guaranteed that the elements in the cycles can flow.\nScala copysource// WARNING!

Hence, we avoided the deadlock, but source is still back-pressured forever, because buffer space is never recovered: the only action we see is the circulation of a couple of initial elements from source.\nNote What we see here is that in certain cases we need to choose between boundedness and liveness. Our first example would not deadlock if there were an infinite buffer in the loop, or vice versa, if the elements in the cycle were balanced (as many elements are removed as many are injected) then there would be no deadlock.\nTo make our cycle both live (not deadlocking) and fair we can introduce a dropping element on the feedback arc. In this case we chose the buffer() operation giving it a dropping strategy OverflowStrategy.dropHead.\nScala copysourceRunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit b =>\n  import GraphDSL.Implicits._\n\n  val merge = b.add(Merge[Int](2))\n  val bcast = b.add(Broadcast[Int](2))\n\n  source ~> merge ~> Flow[Int].map { s => println(s); s } ~> bcast ~> Sink.ignore\n      merge <~ Flow[Int].buffer(10, OverflowStrategy.dropHead) <~ bcast\n  ClosedShape\n}) Java copysourceRunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n    GraphDSL.create(\n        b -> {\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> merge = b.add(Merge.create(2));\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> bcast = b.add(Broadcast.create(2));\n          final FlowShape<Integer, Integer> droppyFlow =\n              b.add(Flow.of(Integer.class).buffer(10, OverflowStrategy.dropHead()));\n          final Outlet<Integer> src = b.add(source).out();\n          final FlowShape<Integer, Integer> printer = b.add(printFlow);\n          final SinkShape<Integer> ignore = b.add(Sink.ignore());\n\n          b.from(src).viaFanIn(merge).via(printer).viaFanOut(bcast).to(ignore);\n          b.to(merge).via(droppyFlow).fromFanOut(bcast);\n          return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n        }));\nIf we run this example we see that\nThe flow of elements does not stop, there are always elements printed We see that some of the numbers are printed several times over time (due to the feedback loop) but on average the numbers are increasing in the long term\nThis example highlights that one solution to avoid deadlocks in the presence of potentially unbalanced cycles (cycles where the number of circulating elements are unbounded) is to drop elements. An alternative would be to define a larger buffer with OverflowStrategy.fail which would fail the stream instead of deadlocking it after all buffer space has been consumed.\nAs we discovered in the previous examples, the core problem was the unbalanced nature of the feedback loop. We circumvented this issue by adding a dropping element, but now we want to build a cycle that is balanced from the beginning instead. To achieve this we modify our first graph by replacing the Merge junction with a ZipWith. Since ZipWith takes one element from source and from the feedback arc to inject one element into the cycle, we maintain the balance of elements.\nScala copysource// WARNING!

After some investigation we realize that:\nIn order to get the first element from source into the cycle we need an already existing element in the cycle In order to get an initial element in the cycle we need an element from source\nThese two conditions are a typical “chicken-and-egg” problem. The solution is to inject an initial element into the cycle that is independent from source. We do this by using a Concat junction on the backwards arc that injects a single element using Source.single.\nScala copysourceRunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit b =>\n  import GraphDSL.Implicits._\n\n  val zip = b.add(ZipWith((left: Int, right: Int) => left))\n  val bcast = b.add(Broadcast[Int](2))\n  val concat = b.add(Concat[Int]())\n  val start = Source.single(0)\n\n  source ~> zip.in0\n  zip.out.map { s => println(s); s } ~> bcast ~> Sink.ignore\n  zip.in1 <~ concat <~ start\n             concat         <~          bcast\n  ClosedShape\n}) Java copysourceRunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n    GraphDSL.create(\n        b -> {\n          final FanInShape2<Integer, Integer, Integer> zip =\n              b.add(ZipWith.create((Integer left, Integer right) -> left));\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> bcast = b.add(Broadcast.create(2));\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> concat = b.add(Concat.create());\n          final FlowShape<Integer, Integer> printer = b.add(printFlow);\n          final SinkShape<Integer> ignore = b.add(Sink.ignore());\n\n          b.from(b.add(source)).toInlet(zip.in0());\n          b.from(zip.out()).via(printer).viaFanOut(bcast).to(ignore);\n          b.to(zip.in1()).viaFanIn(concat).from(b.add(Source.single(1)));\n          b.to(concat).fromFanOut(bcast);\n          return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n        }));\nWhen we run the above example we see that processing starts and never stops. The important takeaway from this example is that balanced cycles often need an initial “kick-off” element to be injected into the cycle.","title":"Graph cycles, liveness and deadlocks"},{"location":"/stream/stream-composition.html","text":"","title":"Modularity, Composition and Hierarchy"},{"location":"/stream/stream-composition.html#modularity-composition-and-hierarchy","text":"","title":"Modularity, Composition and Hierarchy"},{"location":"/stream/stream-composition.html#dependency","text":"To use Pekko Streams, add the module to your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-stream\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-stream_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-stream_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/stream/stream-composition.html#introduction","text":"Pekko Streams provide a uniform model of stream processing graphs, which allows flexible composition of reusable components. In this chapter we show how these look like from the conceptual and API perspective, demonstrating the modularity aspects of the library.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/stream/stream-composition.html#basics-of-composition-and-modularity","text":"Every operator used in Pekko Streams can be imagined as a “box” with input and output ports where elements to be processed arrive and leave the operator. In this view, a Source is nothing else than a “box” with a single output port, or, a BidiFlow is a “box” with exactly two input and two output ports. In the figure below we illustrate the most commonly used operators viewed as “boxes”.\nThe linear operators are Source, Sink and Flow, as these can be used to compose strict chains of operators. Fan-in and Fan-out operators have usually multiple input or multiple output ports, therefore they allow to build more complex graph layouts, not only chains. BidiFlow operators are usually useful in IO related tasks, where there are input and output channels to be handled. Due to the specific shape of BidiFlow it is easy to stack them on top of each other to build a layered protocol for example. The TLS support in Pekko is for example implemented as a BidiFlow.\nThese reusable components already allow the creation of complex processing networks. What we have seen so far does not implement modularity though. It is desirable for example to package up a larger graph entity into a reusable component which hides its internals only exposing the ports that are meant to the users of the module to interact with. One good example is the Http server component, which is encoded internally as a BidiFlow which interfaces with the client TCP connection using an input-output port pair accepting and sending ByteString s, while its upper ports emit and receive HttpRequest and HttpResponse instances.\nThe following figure demonstrates various composite operators, that contain various other type of operators internally, but hiding them behind a shape that looks like a Source, Flow, etc.\nOne interesting example above is a Flow which is composed of a disconnected Sink and Source. This can be achieved by using the fromSinkAndSource() constructor method on Flow which takes the two parts as parameters.\nPlease note that when combining a Flow using that method, the termination signals are not carried “through” as the Sink and Source are assumed to be fully independent. If however you want to construct a Flow like this but need the termination events to trigger “the other side” of the composite flow, you can use Flow.fromSinkAndSourceCoupled or Flow.fromSinkAndSourceCoupledMat which does just that. For example the cancellation of the composite flows source-side will then lead to completion of its sink-side. Read FlowFlow’s API documentation for a detailed explanation how this works.\nThe example BidiFlow demonstrates that internally a module can be of arbitrary complexity, and the exposed ports can be wired in flexible ways. The only constraint is that all the ports of enclosed modules must be either connected to each other, or exposed as interface ports, and the number of such ports needs to match the requirement of the shape, for example a Source allows only one exposed output port, the rest of the internal ports must be properly connected.\nThese mechanics allow arbitrary nesting of modules. For example the following figure demonstrates a RunnableGraph that is built from a composite Source and a composite Sink (which in turn contains a composite Flow).\nThe above diagram contains one more shape that we have not seen yet, which is called RunnableGraph. It turns out, that if we wire all exposed ports together, so that no more open ports remain, we get a module that is closed. This is what the RunnableGraph class represents. This is the shape that a Materializer can take and turn into a network of running entities that perform the task described. In fact, a RunnableGraph is a module itself, and (maybe somewhat surprisingly) it can be used as part of larger graphs. It is rarely useful to embed a closed graph shape in a larger graph (since it becomes an isolated island as there are no open port for communication with the rest of the graph), but this demonstrates the uniform underlying model.\nIf we try to build a code snippet that corresponds to the above diagram, our first try might look like this:\nScala copysourceSource.single(0).map(_ + 1).filter(_ != 0).map(_ - 2).to(Sink.fold(0)(_ + _))\n\n// ... where is the nesting? Java copysourceSource.single(0)\n    .map(i -> i + 1)\n    .filter(i -> i != 0)\n    .map(i -> i - 2)\n    .to(Sink.fold(0, (acc, i) -> acc + i));\n\n// ... where is the nesting?\nIt is clear however that there is no nesting present in our first attempt. Since the library cannot figure out where we intended to put composite module boundaries, it is our responsibility to do that. If we are using the DSL provided by the Flow, Source, Sink classes then nesting can be achieved by calling one of the methods withAttributes() or named() (where the latter is a shorthand for adding a name attribute).\nThe following code demonstrates how to achieve the desired nesting:\nScala copysourceval nestedSource =\n  Source\n    .single(0) // An atomic source\n    .map(_ + 1) // an atomic processing stage\n    .named(\"nestedSource\") // wraps up the current Source and gives it a name\n\nval nestedFlow =\n  Flow[Int]\n    .filter(_ != 0) // an atomic processing stage\n    .map(_ - 2) // another atomic processing stage\n    .named(\"nestedFlow\") // wraps up the Flow, and gives it a name\n\nval nestedSink =\n  nestedFlow\n    .to(Sink.fold(0)(_ + _)) // wire an atomic sink to the nestedFlow\n    .named(\"nestedSink\") // wrap it up\n\n// Create a RunnableGraph\nval runnableGraph = nestedSource.to(nestedSink) Java copysourcefinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> nestedSource =\n    Source.single(0) // An atomic source\n        .map(i -> i + 1) // an atomic processing stage\n        .named(\"nestedSource\"); // wraps up the current Source and gives it a name\n\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> nestedFlow =\n    Flow.of(Integer.class)\n        .filter(i -> i != 0) // an atomic processing stage\n        .map(i -> i - 2) // another atomic processing stage\n        .named(\"nestedFlow\"); // wraps up the Flow, and gives it a name\n\nfinal Sink<Integer, NotUsed> nestedSink =\n    nestedFlow\n        .to(Sink.fold(0, (acc, i) -> acc + i)) // wire an atomic sink to the nestedFlow\n        .named(\"nestedSink\"); // wrap it up\n\n// Create a RunnableGraph\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> runnableGraph = nestedSource.to(nestedSink);\nOnce we have hidden the internals of our components, they act like any other built-in component of similar shape. If we hide some of the internals of our composites, the result looks just like if any other predefine component has been used:\nIf we look at usage of built-in components, and our custom components, there is no difference in usage as the code snippet below demonstrates.\nScala copysource// Create a RunnableGraph from our components\nval runnableGraph = nestedSource.to(nestedSink)\n\n// Usage is uniform, no matter if modules are composite or atomic\nval runnableGraph2 = Source.single(0).to(Sink.fold(0)(_ + _)) Java copysource// Create a RunnableGraph from our components\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> runnableGraph = nestedSource.to(nestedSink);\n\n// Usage is uniform, no matter if modules are composite or atomic\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> runnableGraph2 =\n    Source.single(0).to(Sink.fold(0, (acc, i) -> acc + i));","title":"Basics of composition and modularity"},{"location":"/stream/stream-composition.html#composing-complex-systems","text":"In the previous section we explored the possibility of composition, and hierarchy, but we stayed away from non-linear, generalized operators. There is nothing in Pekko Streams though that enforces that stream processing layouts can only be linear. The DSL for Source and friends is optimized for creating such linear chains, as they are the most common in practice. There is a more advanced DSL for building complex graphs, that can be used if more flexibility is needed. We will see that the difference between the two DSLs is only on the surface: the concepts they operate on are uniform across all DSLs and fit together nicely.\nAs a first example, let’s look at a more complex layout:\nThe diagram shows a RunnableGraph (remember, if there are no unwired ports, the graph is closed, and therefore can be materialized) that encapsulates a non-trivial stream processing network. It contains fan-in, fan-out operators, directed and non-directed cycles. The runnable() method of the GraphDSL object allows the creation of a general, closed, and runnable graph. For example the network on the diagram can be realized like this:\nScala copysourceimport GraphDSL.Implicits._\nRunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n  val A: Outlet[Int]                  = builder.add(Source.single(0)).out\n  val B: UniformFanOutShape[Int, Int] = builder.add(Broadcast[Int](2))\n  val C: UniformFanInShape[Int, Int]  = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n  val D: FlowShape[Int, Int]          = builder.add(Flow[Int].map(_ + 1))\n  val E: UniformFanOutShape[Int, Int] = builder.add(Balance[Int](2))\n  val F: UniformFanInShape[Int, Int]  = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n  val G: Inlet[Any]                   = builder.add(Sink.foreach(println)).in\n\n                C     <~      F\n  A  ~>  B  ~>  C     ~>      F\n         B  ~>  D  ~>  E  ~>  F\n                       E  ~>  G\n\n  ClosedShape\n}) Java copysourceRunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n    GraphDSL.create(\n        builder -> {\n          final Outlet<Integer> A = builder.add(Source.single(0)).out();\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> B = builder.add(Broadcast.create(2));\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> C = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n          final FlowShape<Integer, Integer> D =\n              builder.add(Flow.of(Integer.class).map(i -> i + 1));\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> E = builder.add(Balance.create(2));\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> F = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n          final Inlet<Integer> G = builder.add(Sink.<Integer>foreach(System.out::println)).in();\n\n          builder.from(F).toFanIn(C);\n          builder.from(A).viaFanOut(B).viaFanIn(C).toFanIn(F);\n          builder.from(B).via(D).viaFanOut(E).toFanIn(F);\n          builder.from(E).toInlet(G);\n          return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n        }));\nIn the code above we used the implicit port numbering feature (to make the graph more readable and similar to the diagram) and we imported Source s, Sink s and Flow s explicitly. It is possible to refer to the ports explicitly, and it is not necessary to import our linear operators via add(), so another version might look like this:\nScala copysourceimport GraphDSL.Implicits._\nRunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n  val B = builder.add(Broadcast[Int](2))\n  val C = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n  val E = builder.add(Balance[Int](2))\n  val F = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n\n  Source.single(0) ~> B.in; B.out(0) ~> C.in(1); C.out ~> F.in(0)\n  C.in(0) <~ F.out\n\n  B.out(1).map(_ + 1) ~> E.in; E.out(0) ~> F.in(1)\n  E.out(1) ~> Sink.foreach(println)\n  ClosedShape\n}) Java copysourceRunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n    GraphDSL.create(\n        builder -> {\n          final SourceShape<Integer> A = builder.add(Source.single(0));\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> B = builder.add(Broadcast.create(2));\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> C = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n          final FlowShape<Integer, Integer> D =\n              builder.add(Flow.of(Integer.class).map(i -> i + 1));\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> E = builder.add(Balance.create(2));\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> F = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n          final SinkShape<Integer> G = builder.add(Sink.foreach(System.out::println));\n\n          builder.from(F.out()).toInlet(C.in(0));\n          builder.from(A).toInlet(B.in());\n          builder.from(B.out(0)).toInlet(C.in(1));\n          builder.from(C.out()).toInlet(F.in(0));\n          builder.from(B.out(1)).via(D).toInlet(E.in());\n          builder.from(E.out(0)).toInlet(F.in(1));\n          builder.from(E.out(1)).to(G);\n          return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n        }));\nSimilar to the case in the first section, so far we have not considered modularity. We created a complex graph, but the layout is flat, not modularized. We will modify our example, and create a reusable component with the graph DSL. The way to do it is to use the create() factory method on GraphDSL. If we remove the sources and sinks from the previous example, what remains is a partial graph:\nWe can recreate a similar graph in code, using the DSL in a similar way than before:\nScala copysourceimport GraphDSL.Implicits._\nval partial = GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n  val B = builder.add(Broadcast[Int](2))\n  val C = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n  val E = builder.add(Balance[Int](2))\n  val F = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n\n                                   C  <~  F\n  B  ~>                            C  ~>  F\n  B  ~>  Flow[Int].map(_ + 1)  ~>  E  ~>  F\n  FlowShape(B.in, E.out(1))\n}.named(\"partial\") Java copysourcefinal Graph<FlowShape<Integer, Integer>, NotUsed> partial =\n    GraphDSL.create(\n        builder -> {\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> B = builder.add(Broadcast.create(2));\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> C = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n          final UniformFanOutShape<Integer, Integer> E = builder.add(Balance.create(2));\n          final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> F = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n\n          builder.from(F.out()).toInlet(C.in(0));\n          builder.from(B).viaFanIn(C).toFanIn(F);\n          builder\n              .from(B)\n              .via(builder.add(Flow.of(Integer.class).map(i -> i + 1)))\n              .viaFanOut(E)\n              .toFanIn(F);\n\n          return new FlowShape<Integer, Integer>(B.in(), E.out(1));\n        });\nThe only new addition is the return value of the builder block, which is a Shape. All operators (including Source, BidiFlow, etc.) have a shape, which encodes the typed ports of the module. In our example there is exactly one input and output port left, so we can declare it to have a FlowShape by returning an instance of it. While it is possible to create new Shape types, it is usually recommended to use one of the matching built-in ones.\nThe resulting graph is already a properly wrapped module, so there is no need to call named() to encapsulate the graph, but it is a good practice to give names to modules to help debugging.\nSince our partial graph has the right shape, it can be already used in the simpler, linear DSL:\nScala copysourceSource.single(0).via(partial).to(Sink.ignore) Java copysourceSource.single(0).via(partial).to(Sink.ignore());\nIt is not possible to use it as a Flow yet, though (i.e. we cannot call .filter() on it), but Flow has a fromGraph() method that adds the DSL to a FlowShape. There are similar methods on Source, Sink and BidiShape, so it is easy to get back to the simpler DSL if an operator has the right shape. For convenience, it is also possible to skip the partial graph creation, and use one of the convenience creator methods. To demonstrate this, we will create the following graph:\nThe code version of the above closed graph might look like this:\nScala copysource// Convert the partial graph of FlowShape to a Flow to get\n// access to the fluid DSL (for example to be able to call .filter())\nval flow = Flow.fromGraph(partial)\n\n// Simple way to create a graph backed Source\nval source = Source.fromGraph( GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n  val merge = builder.add(Merge[Int](2))\n  Source.single(0)      ~> merge\n  Source(List(2, 3, 4)) ~> merge\n\n  // Exposing exactly one output port\n  SourceShape(merge.out)\n})\n\n// Building a Sink with a nested Flow, using the fluid DSL\nval sink = {\n  val nestedFlow = Flow[Int].map(_ * 2).drop(10).named(\"nestedFlow\")\n  nestedFlow.to(Sink.head)\n}\n\n// Putting all together\nval closed = source.via(flow.filter(_ > 1)).to(sink) Java copysource// Convert the partial graph of FlowShape to a Flow to get\n// access to the fluid DSL (for example to be able to call .filter())\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> flow = Flow.fromGraph(partial);\n\n// Simple way to create a graph backed Source\nfinal Source<Integer, NotUsed> source =\n    Source.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            builder -> {\n              final UniformFanInShape<Integer, Integer> merge = builder.add(Merge.create(2));\n              builder.from(builder.add(Source.single(0))).toFanIn(merge);\n              builder.from(builder.add(Source.from(Arrays.asList(2, 3, 4)))).toFanIn(merge);\n              // Exposing exactly one output port\n              return new SourceShape<Integer>(merge.out());\n            }));\n\n// Building a Sink with a nested Flow, using the fluid DSL\nfinal Sink<Integer, NotUsed> sink =\n    Flow.of(Integer.class).map(i -> i * 2).drop(10).named(\"nestedFlow\").to(Sink.head());\n\n// Putting all together\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> closed = source.via(flow.filter(i -> i > 1)).to(sink);\nNote All graph builder sections check if the resulting graph has all ports connected except the exposed ones and will throw an exception if this is violated.\nWe are still in debt of demonstrating that RunnableGraph is a component like any other, which can be embedded in graphs. In the following snippet we embed one closed graph in another:\nScala copysourceval closed1 = Source.single(0).to(Sink.foreach(println))\nval closed2 = RunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n  val embeddedClosed: ClosedShape = builder.add(closed1)\n  // …\n  embeddedClosed\n}) Java copysourcefinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> closed1 = Source.single(0).to(Sink.foreach(System.out::println));\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> closed2 =\n    RunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            builder -> {\n              final ClosedShape embeddedClosed = builder.add(closed1);\n              return embeddedClosed; // Could return ClosedShape.getInstance()\n            }));\nThe type of the imported module indicates that the imported module has a ClosedShape, and so we are not able to wire it to anything else inside the enclosing closed graph. Nevertheless, this “island” is embedded properly, and will be materialized just like any other module that is part of the graph.\nAs we have demonstrated, the two DSLs are fully interoperable, as they encode a similar nested structure of “boxes with ports”, it is only the DSLs that differ to be as much powerful as possible on the given abstraction level. It is possible to embed complex graphs in the fluid DSL, and it is just as easy to import and embed a Flow, etc, in a larger, complex structure.\nWe have also seen, that every module has a Shape (for example a Sink has a SinkShape) independently which DSL was used to create it. This uniform representation enables the rich composability of various stream processing entities in a convenient way.","title":"Composing complex systems"},{"location":"/stream/stream-composition.html#materialized-values","text":"After realizing that RunnableGraph is nothing more than a module with no unused ports (it is an island), it becomes clear that after materialization the only way to communicate with the running stream processing logic is via some side-channel. This side channel is represented as a materialized value. The situation is similar to Actor s, where the Props instance describes the actor logic, but it is the call to actorOf() that creates an actually running actor, and returns an ActorRef that can be used to communicate with the running actor itself. Since the Props can be reused, each call will return a different reference.\nWhen it comes to streams, each materialization creates a new running network corresponding to the blueprint that was encoded in the provided RunnableGraph. To be able to interact with the running network, each materialization needs to return a different object that provides the necessary interaction capabilities. In other words, the RunnableGraph can be seen as a factory, which creates:\na network of running processing entities, inaccessible from the outside a materialized value, optionally providing a controlled interaction capability with the network\nUnlike actors though, each of the operators might provide a materialized value, so when we compose multiple operators or modules, we need to combine the materialized value as well (there are default rules which make this easier, for example to() and via() takes care of the most common case of taking the materialized value to the left. See Combining materialized values for details). We demonstrate how this works by a code example and a diagram which graphically demonstrates what is happening.\nThe propagation of the individual materialized values from the enclosed modules towards the top will look like this:\nTo implement the above, first, we create a composite Source, where the enclosed Source have a materialized type of Promise[[Option[Int]] CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>>>. By using the combiner function Keep.left, the resulting materialized type is of the nested module (indicated by the color red on the diagram):\nScala copysource// Materializes to Promise[Option[Int]]                                   (red)\nval source: Source[Int, Promise[Option[Int]]] = Source.maybe[Int]\n\n// Materializes to NotUsed                                               (black)\nval flow1: Flow[Int, Int, NotUsed] = Flow[Int].take(100)\n\n// Materializes to Promise[Int]                                          (red)\nval nestedSource: Source[Int, Promise[Option[Int]]] =\n  source.viaMat(flow1)(Keep.left).named(\"nestedSource\") Java copysource// Materializes to CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>>                   (red)\nfinal Source<Integer, CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>>> source = Source.<Integer>maybe();\n\n// Materializes to NotUsed                                                (black)\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> flow1 = Flow.of(Integer.class).take(100);\n\n// Materializes to CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>>                  (red)\nfinal Source<Integer, CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>>> nestedSource =\n    source.viaMat(flow1, Keep.left()).named(\"nestedSource\");\nNext, we create a composite Flow from two smaller components. Here, the second enclosed Flow has a materialized type of Future[OutgoingConnection] CompletionStage<OutgoingConnection>, and we propagate this to the parent by using Keep.right as the combiner function (indicated by the color yellow on the diagram):\nScala copysource// Materializes to NotUsed                                                (orange)\nval flow2: Flow[Int, ByteString, NotUsed] = Flow[Int].map { i =>\n  ByteString(i.toString)\n}\n\n// Materializes to Future[OutgoingConnection]                             (yellow)\nval flow3: Flow[ByteString, ByteString, Future[OutgoingConnection]] =\n  Tcp(system).outgoingConnection(\"localhost\", 8080)\n\n// Materializes to Future[OutgoingConnection]                             (yellow)\nval nestedFlow: Flow[Int, ByteString, Future[OutgoingConnection]] =\n  flow2.viaMat(flow3)(Keep.right).named(\"nestedFlow\") Java copysource// Materializes to NotUsed                                                (orange)\nfinal Flow<Integer, ByteString, NotUsed> flow2 =\n    Flow.of(Integer.class).map(i -> ByteString.fromString(i.toString()));\n\n// Materializes to Future<OutgoingConnection>                             (yellow)\nfinal Flow<ByteString, ByteString, CompletionStage<OutgoingConnection>> flow3 =\n    Tcp.get(system).outgoingConnection(\"localhost\", 8080);\n\n// Materializes to Future<OutgoingConnection>                             (yellow)\nfinal Flow<Integer, ByteString, CompletionStage<OutgoingConnection>> nestedFlow =\n    flow2.viaMat(flow3, Keep.right()).named(\"nestedFlow\");\nAs a third step, we create a composite Sink, using our nestedFlow as a building block. In this snippet, both the enclosed Flow and the folding Sink has a materialized value that is interesting for us, so we use Keep.both to get a Pair of them as the materialized type of nestedSink (indicated by the color blue on the diagram)\nScala copysource// Materializes to Future[String]                                         (green)\nval sink: Sink[ByteString, Future[String]] = Sink.fold(\"\")(_ + _.utf8String)\n\n// Materializes to (Future[OutgoingConnection], Future[String])           (blue)\nval nestedSink: Sink[Int, (Future[OutgoingConnection], Future[String])] =\n  nestedFlow.toMat(sink)(Keep.both) Java copysource// Materializes to Future<String>                                         (green)\nfinal Sink<ByteString, CompletionStage<String>> sink =\n    Sink.<String, ByteString>fold(\"\", (acc, i) -> acc + i.utf8String());\n\n// Materializes to Pair<Future<OutgoingConnection>, Future<String>>       (blue)\nfinal Sink<Integer, Pair<CompletionStage<OutgoingConnection>, CompletionStage<String>>>\n    nestedSink = nestedFlow.toMat(sink, Keep.both());\nAs the last example, we wire together nestedSource and nestedSink and we use a custom combiner function to create a yet another materialized type of the resulting RunnableGraph. This combiner function ignores the Future[String] CompletionStage<String> part, and wraps the other two values in a custom case class MyClass (indicated by color purple on the diagram):\nScala copysourcecase class MyClass(private val p: Promise[Option[Int]], conn: OutgoingConnection) {\n  def close() = p.trySuccess(None)\n}\n\ndef f(p: Promise[Option[Int]], rest: (Future[OutgoingConnection], Future[String])): Future[MyClass] = {\n\n  val connFuture = rest._1\n  connFuture.map(MyClass(p, _))\n}\n\n// Materializes to Future[MyClass]                                        (purple)\nval runnableGraph: RunnableGraph[Future[MyClass]] =\n  nestedSource.toMat(nestedSink)(f) Java copysourcestatic class MyClass {\n  private CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>> p;\n  private OutgoingConnection conn;\n\n  public MyClass(CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>> p, OutgoingConnection conn) {\n    this.p = p;\n    this.conn = conn;\n  }\n\n  public void close() {\n    p.complete(Optional.empty());\n  }\n}\n\nstatic class Combiner {\n  static CompletionStage<MyClass> f(\n      CompletableFuture<Optional<Integer>> p,\n      Pair<CompletionStage<OutgoingConnection>, CompletionStage<String>> rest) {\n    return rest.first().thenApply(c -> new MyClass(p, c));\n  }\n} copysource// Materializes to Future<MyClass>                                        (purple)\nfinal RunnableGraph<CompletionStage<MyClass>> runnableGraph =\n    nestedSource.toMat(nestedSink, Combiner::f);\nNote The nested structure in the above example is not necessary for combining the materialized values, it demonstrates how the two features work together.

Apart from having the effect of adding a nesting level, named() is actually a shorthand for calling addAttributes(Attributes.name(\"someName\")), adding the name attribute to the graph.\nAttributes provide a way to fine-tune certain aspects of the materialized running entity. Attributes are inherited by nested modules, unless they override them with a custom value. This means the attribute specified closest to the operator in the graph will be the one that is in effect for that operator.\nAnother example of an attribute is the inputBuffer attribute which has the main purpose to provide control over buffer sizes for asynchronous boundaries (see Buffers for asynchronous operators).\nThe code below, a modification of an earlier example sets the inputBuffer attribute on certain modules, but not on others.

Being run asynchronously means that an operator, after handing out an element to its downstream consumer is able to immediately process the next message. To demonstrate what we mean by this, let’s take a look at the following example:\nScala copysourceSource(1 to 3)\n  .map { i =>\n    println(s\"A: $i\"); i\n  }\n  .async\n  .map { i =>\n    println(s\"B: $i\"); i\n  }\n  .async\n  .map { i =>\n    println(s\"C: $i\"); i\n  }\n  .async\n  .runWith(Sink.ignore) Java copysourceSource.from(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3))\n    .map(\n        i -> {\n          System.out.println(\"A: \" + i);\n          return i;\n        })\n    .async()\n    .map(\n        i -> {\n          System.out.println(\"B: \" + i);\n          return i;\n        })\n    .async()\n    .map(\n        i -> {\n          System.out.println(\"C: \" + i);\n          return i;\n        })\n    .async()\n    .runWith(Sink.ignore(), system);\nRunning the above example, one of the possible outputs looks like this:\nA: 1\nA: 2\nB: 1\nA: 3\nB: 2\nC: 1\nB: 3\nC: 2\nC: 3\nNote that the order is not A:1, B:1, C:1, A:2, B:2, C:2, which would correspond to the normal fused synchronous execution model of flows where an element completely passes through the processing pipeline before the next element enters the flow. The next element is processed by an asynchronous operator as soon as it has emitted the previous one.\nWhile pipelining in general increases throughput, in practice there is a cost of passing an element through the asynchronous (and therefore thread crossing) boundary which is significant. To amortize this cost Pekko Streams uses a windowed, batching backpressure strategy internally. It is windowed because as opposed to a Stop-And-Wait protocol multiple elements might be “in-flight” concurrently with requests for elements. It is also batching because a new element is not immediately requested once an element has been drained from the window-buffer but multiple elements are requested after multiple elements have been drained. This batching strategy reduces the communication cost of propagating the backpressure signal through the asynchronous boundary.\nWhile this internal protocol is mostly invisible to the user (apart from its throughput increasing effects) there are situations when these details get exposed. In all of our previous examples we always assumed that the rate of the processing chain is strictly coordinated through the backpressure signal causing all operators to process no faster than the throughput of the connected chain. There are tools in Pekko Streams however that enable the rates of different segments of a processing chain to be “detached” or to define the maximum throughput of the stream through external timing sources. These situations are exactly those where the internal batching buffering strategy suddenly becomes non-transparent.","title":"Buffers for asynchronous operators"},{"location":"/stream/stream-rate.html#internal-buffers-and-their-effect","text":"As we have explained, for performance reasons Pekko Streams introduces a buffer for every asynchronous operator. The purpose of these buffers is solely optimization, in fact the size of 1 would be the most natural choice if there would be no need for throughput improvements. Therefore it is recommended to keep these buffer sizes small, and increase them only to a level suitable for the throughput requirements of the application. Default buffer sizes can be set through configuration:\npekko.stream.materializer.max-input-buffer-size = 16\nAlternatively they can be set per stream by adding an attribute to the complete RunnableGraph or on smaller segments of the stream it is possible by defining a separate `Flow``Flow` with these attributes:\nScala copysourceval section = Flow[Int].map(_ * 2).async.addAttributes(Attributes.inputBuffer(initial = 1, max = 1)) // the buffer size of this map is 1\nval flow = section.via(Flow[Int].map(_ / 2)).async // the buffer size of this map is the default\nval runnableGraph =\n  Source(1 to 10).via(flow).to(Sink.foreach(elem => println(elem)))\n\nval withOverriddenDefaults = runnableGraph.withAttributes(Attributes.inputBuffer(initial = 64, max = 64)) Java copysourcefinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> flow1 =\n    Flow.of(Integer.class)\n        .map(elem -> elem * 2)\n        .async()\n        .addAttributes(Attributes.inputBuffer(1, 1)); // the buffer size of this map is 1\nfinal Flow<Integer, Integer, NotUsed> flow2 =\n    flow1\n        .via(Flow.of(Integer.class).map(elem -> elem / 2))\n        .async(); // the buffer size of this map is the value from the surrounding graph it is\n// used in\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> runnableGraph =\n    Source.range(1, 10).via(flow1).to(Sink.foreach(elem -> System.out.println(elem)));\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> withOverridenDefaults =\n    runnableGraph.withAttributes(Attributes.inputBuffer(64, 64));\nHere is an example of a code that demonstrate some of the issues caused by internal buffers:\nScala copysourceimport scala.concurrent.duration._\ncase class Tick()\n\nRunnableGraph.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit b =>\n  import GraphDSL.Implicits._\n\n  // this is the asynchronous stage in this graph\n  val zipper = b.add(ZipWith[Tick, Int, Int]((tick, count) => count).async)\n\n  Source.tick(initialDelay = 3.second, interval = 3.second, Tick()) ~> zipper.in0\n\n  Source\n    .tick(initialDelay = 1.second, interval = 1.second, \"message!\")\n    .conflateWithSeed(seed = _ => 1)((count, _) => count + 1) ~> zipper.in1\n\n  zipper.out ~> Sink.foreach(println)\n  ClosedShape\n}) Java copysourcefinal Duration oneSecond = Duration.ofSeconds(1);\nfinal Source<String, Cancellable> msgSource = Source.tick(oneSecond, oneSecond, \"message!\");\nfinal Source<String, Cancellable> tickSource =\n    Source.tick(oneSecond.multipliedBy(3), oneSecond.multipliedBy(3), \"tick\");\nfinal Flow<String, Integer, NotUsed> conflate =\n    Flow.of(String.class).conflateWithSeed(first -> 1, (count, elem) -> count + 1);\n\nRunnableGraph.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            b -> {\n              // this is the asynchronous stage in this graph\n              final FanInShape2<String, Integer, Integer> zipper =\n                  b.add(ZipWith.create((String tick, Integer count) -> count).async());\n              b.from(b.add(msgSource)).via(b.add(conflate)).toInlet(zipper.in1());\n              b.from(b.add(tickSource)).toInlet(zipper.in0());\n              b.from(zipper.out()).to(b.add(Sink.foreach(elem -> System.out.println(elem))));\n              return ClosedShape.getInstance();\n            }))\n    .run(system);\nRunning the above example one would expect the number 3 to be printed in every 3 seconds (the conflateWithSeed step here is configured so that it counts the number of elements received before the downstream `ZipWith``ZipWith` consumes them). What is being printed is different though, we will see the number 1. The reason for this is the internal buffer which is by default 16 elements large, and prefetches elements before the `ZipWith``ZipWith` starts consuming them. It is possible to fix this issue by changing the buffer size of `ZipWith``ZipWith` to 1. We will still see a leading 1 though which is caused by an initial prefetch of the `ZipWith``ZipWith` element.\nNote In general, when time or rate driven operators exhibit strange behavior, one of the first solutions to try should be to decrease the input buffer of the affected elements to 1.","title":"Internal buffers and their effect"},{"location":"/stream/stream-rate.html#buffers-in-pekko-streams","text":"In this section we will discuss explicit user defined buffers that are part of the domain logic of the stream processing pipeline of an application.\nThe example below will ensure that 1000 jobs (but not more) are dequeued from an external (imaginary) system and stored locally in memory - relieving the external system:\nScala copysource// Getting a stream of jobs from an imaginary external system as a Source\nval jobs: Source[Job, NotUsed] = inboundJobsConnector()\njobs.buffer(1000, OverflowStrategy.backpressure) Java copysource// Getting a stream of jobs from an imaginary external system as a Source\nfinal Source<Job, NotUsed> jobs = inboundJobsConnector;\njobs.buffer(1000, OverflowStrategy.backpressure());\nThe next example will also queue up 1000 jobs locally, but if there are more jobs waiting in the imaginary external systems, it makes space for the new element by dropping one element from the tail of the buffer.

This is intentional: in the use case of keeping track of a read offset, if the FlowWithContextFlowWithContext was allowed to arbitrarily filter and reorder the stream, the SinkSink would have no way to determine whether an element was skipped or merely reordered and still in flight.\nFor this reason, FlowWithContextFlowWithContext allows filtering operations (such as filter, filterNot, collect, etc.) and grouping operations (such as grouped, sliding, etc.) but not reordering operations (such as mapAsyncUnordered and statefulMapConcat). Finally, also ‘one-to-n’ operations such as mapConcat are allowed.\nFiltering operations will drop the context along with dropped elements, while grouping operations will keep all contexts from the elements in the group. Streaming one-to-many operations such as mapConcat associate the original context with each of the produced elements.\nAs an escape hatch, there is a via operator that allows you to insert an arbitrary FlowFlow that can process the tuplespairs of elements and context in any way desired.

This will materialize to a\n// corresponding Source.\n// (We need to use toMat and Keep.right since by default the materialized\n// value to the left is used)\nRunnableGraph<Source<String, NotUsed>> runnableGraph =\n    producer.toMat(\n        PartitionHub.of(String.class, (size, elem) -> Math.abs(elem.hashCode() % size), 2, 256),\n        Keep.right());\n\n// By running/materializing the producer, we get back a Source, which\n// gives us access to the elements published by the producer.\nSource<String, NotUsed> fromProducer = runnableGraph.run(materializer);\n\n// Print out messages from the producer in two independent consumers\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg -> System.out.println(\"consumer1: \" + msg), materializer);\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg -> System.out.println(\"consumer2: \" + msg), materializer);\nThe partitioner function takes two parameters; the first is the number of active consumers and the second is the stream element. The function should return the index of the selected consumer for the given element, i.e. int greater than or equal to 0 and less than number of consumers.\nThe resulting SourceSource can be materialized any number of times, each materialization effectively attaching a new consumer. If there are no consumers attached to this hub then it will not drop any elements but instead backpressure the upstream producer until consumers arrive. This behavior can be tweaked by using an operator, for example .buffer.buffer with a drop strategy, or attaching a consumer that drops all messages. If there are no other consumers, this will ensure that the producer is kept drained (dropping all elements) and once a new consumer arrives and messages are routed to the new consumer it will adaptively slow down, ensuring no more messages are dropped.\nIt is possible to define how many initial consumers that are required before it starts emitting any messages to the attached consumers. While not enough consumers have been attached messages are buffered and when the buffer is full the upstream producer is backpressured. No messages are dropped.\nThe above example illustrate a stateless partition function. For more advanced stateful routing the ofStateful statefulSink can be used. Here is an example of a stateful round-robin function:\nScala copysource// A simple producer that publishes a new \"message-\" every second\nval producer = Source.tick(1.second, 1.second, \"message\").zipWith(Source(1 to 100))((a, b) => s\"$a-$b\")\n\n// New instance of the partitioner function and its state is created\n// for each materialization of the PartitionHub.\ndef roundRobin(): (PartitionHub.ConsumerInfo, String) => Long = {\n  var i = -1L\n\n  (info, elem) => {\n    i += 1\n    info.consumerIdByIdx((i % info.size).toInt)\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach a PartitionHub Sink to the producer. This will materialize to a\n// corresponding Source.\n// (We need to use toMat and Keep.right since by default the materialized\n// value to the left is used)\nval runnableGraph: RunnableGraph[Source[String, NotUsed]] =\n  producer.toMat(PartitionHub.statefulSink(() => roundRobin(), startAfterNrOfConsumers = 2, bufferSize = 256))(\n    Keep.right)\n\n// By running/materializing the producer, we get back a Source, which\n// gives us access to the elements published by the producer.\nval fromProducer: Source[String, NotUsed] = runnableGraph.run()\n\n// Print out messages from the producer in two independent consumers\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg => println(\"consumer1: \" + msg))\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg => println(\"consumer2: \" + msg)) Java copysource// A simple producer that publishes a new \"message-n\" every second\nSource<String, Cancellable> producer =\n    Source.tick(Duration.ofSeconds(1), Duration.ofSeconds(1), \"message\")\n        .zipWith(Source.range(0, 100), (a, b) -> a + \"-\" + b);\n\n// Attach a PartitionHub Sink to the producer. This will materialize to a\n// corresponding Source.\n// (We need to use toMat and Keep.right since by default the materialized\n// value to the left is used)\nRunnableGraph<Source<String, NotUsed>> runnableGraph =\n    producer.toMat(\n        PartitionHub.ofStateful(String.class, () -> new RoundRobin<String>(), 2, 256),\n        Keep.right());\n\n// By running/materializing the producer, we get back a Source, which\n// gives us access to the elements published by the producer.\nSource<String, NotUsed> fromProducer = runnableGraph.run(materializer);\n\n// Print out messages from the producer in two independent consumers\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg -> System.out.println(\"consumer1: \" + msg), materializer);\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg -> System.out.println(\"consumer2: \" + msg), materializer);\nNote that it is a factory of a function to be able to hold stateful variables that are unique for each materialization. In this example the partitioner function is implemented as a class to be able to hold the mutable variable. A new instance of RoundRobin is created for each materialization of the hub.\ncopysource// Using a class since variable must otherwise be final.\n// New instance is created for each materialization of the PartitionHub.\nstatic class RoundRobin<T> implements ToLongBiFunction<ConsumerInfo, T> {\n\n  private long i = -1;\n\n  @Override\n  public long applyAsLong(ConsumerInfo info, T elem) {\n    i++;\n    return info.consumerIdByIdx((int) (i % info.size()));\n  }\n}\nThe function takes two parameters; the first is information about active consumers, including an array of consumer identifiers and the second is the stream element. The function should return the selected consumer identifier for the given element. The function will never be called when there are no active consumers, i.e. there is always at least one element in the array of identifiers.\nAnother interesting type of routing is to prefer routing to the fastest consumers. The ConsumerInfoConsumerInfo has an accessor queueSize that is approximate number of buffered elements for a consumer. Larger value than other consumers could be an indication of that the consumer is slow. Note that this is a moving target since the elements are consumed concurrently. Here is an example of a hub that routes to the consumer with least buffered elements:\nScala copysourceval producer = Source(0 until 100)\n\n// ConsumerInfo.queueSize is the approximate number of buffered elements for a consumer.\n// Note that this is a moving target since the elements are consumed concurrently.\nval runnableGraph: RunnableGraph[Source[Int, NotUsed]] =\n  producer.toMat(\n    PartitionHub.statefulSink(\n      () => (info, elem) => info.consumerIds.minBy(id => info.queueSize(id)),\n      startAfterNrOfConsumers = 2,\n      bufferSize = 16))(Keep.right)\n\nval fromProducer: Source[Int, NotUsed] = runnableGraph.run()\n\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg => println(\"consumer1: \" + msg))\nfromProducer.throttle(10, 100.millis).runForeach(msg => println(\"consumer2: \" + msg)) Java copysourceSource<Integer, NotUsed> producer = Source.range(0, 100);\n\n// ConsumerInfo.queueSize is the approximate number of buffered elements for a consumer.\n// Note that this is a moving target since the elements are consumed concurrently.\nRunnableGraph<Source<Integer, NotUsed>> runnableGraph =\n    producer.toMat(\n        PartitionHub.ofStateful(\n            Integer.class,\n            () ->\n                (info, elem) -> {\n                  final List<Object> ids = info.getConsumerIds();\n                  int minValue = info.queueSize(0);\n                  long fastest = info.consumerIdByIdx(0);\n                  for (int i = 1; i < ids.size(); i++) {\n                    int value = info.queueSize(i);\n                    if (value < minValue) {\n                      minValue = value;\n                      fastest = info.consumerIdByIdx(i);\n                    }\n                  }\n                  return fastest;\n                },\n            2,\n            8),\n        Keep.right());\n\nSource<Integer, NotUsed> fromProducer = runnableGraph.run(materializer);\n\nfromProducer.runForeach(msg -> System.out.println(\"consumer1: \" + msg), materializer);\nfromProducer\n    .throttle(10, Duration.ofMillis(100))\n    .runForeach(msg -> System.out.println(\"consumer2: \" + msg), materializer);","title":"Using the PartitionHub"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html","text":"","title":"Custom stream processing"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html#custom-stream-processing","text":"","title":"Custom stream processing"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html#dependency","text":"To use Pekko Streams, add the module to your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-stream\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-stream_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-stream_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html#introduction","text":"While the processing vocabulary of Pekko Streams is quite rich (see the Streams Cookbook for examples) it is sometimes necessary to define new transformation operators either because some functionality is missing from the stock operations, or for performance reasons.

It is a counterpart of the GraphDSL.create()GraphDSL.create() method which creates new stream processing operators by composing others. Where GraphStage differs is that it creates an operator that is itself not divisible into smaller ones, and allows state to be maintained inside it in a safe way.\nAs a first motivating example, we will build a new SourceSource that will emit numbers from 1 until it is cancelled. To start, we need to define the “interface” of our operator, which is called shape in Pekko Streams terminology (this is explained in more detail in the section Modularity, Composition and Hierarchy). This is how it looks:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.stream.stage.GraphStage\n\nclass NumbersSource extends GraphStage[SourceShape[Int]] {\n  // Define the (sole) output port of this stage\n  val out: Outlet[Int] = Outlet(\"NumbersSource\")\n  // Define the shape of this stage, which is SourceShape with the port we defined above\n  override val shape: SourceShape[Int] = SourceShape(out)\n\n  // This is where the actual (possibly stateful) logic will live\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic = ???\n} Java copysourcepublic class NumbersSource extends GraphStage<SourceShape<Integer>> {\n  // Define the (sole) output port of this stage\n  public final Outlet<Integer> out = Outlet.create(\"NumbersSource.out\");\n\n  // Define the shape of this stage, which is SourceShape with the port we defined above\n  private final SourceShape<Integer> shape = SourceShape.of(out);\n\n  @Override\n  public SourceShape<Integer> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  // This is where the actual (possibly stateful) logic is created\n  @Override\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape()) {\n      // All state MUST be inside the GraphStageLogic,\n      // never inside the enclosing GraphStage.\n      // This state is safe to access and modify from all the\n      // callbacks that are provided by GraphStageLogic and the\n      // registered handlers.\n      private int counter = 1;\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                push(out, counter);\n                counter += 1;\n              }\n            });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\nAs you see, in itself the GraphStage only defines the ports of this operator and a shape that contains the ports. It also has, a currently unimplemented method called createLogiccreateLogic. If you recall, operators are reusable in multiple materializations, each resulting in a different executing entity. In the case of GraphStage the actual running logic is modeled as an instance of a GraphStageLogicGraphStageLogic which will be created by the materializer by calling the createLogic method. In other words, all we need to do is to create a suitable logic that will emit the numbers we want.\nNote It is very important to keep the GraphStage object itself immutable and reusable. All mutable state needs to be confined to the GraphStageLogic that is created for every materialization.\nIn order to emit from a SourceSource in a backpressured stream one needs first to have demand from downstream. To receive the necessary events one needs to register a subclass of OutHandler AbstractOutHandler with the output port (OutletOutlet). This handler will receive events related to the lifecycle of the port. In our case we need to override onPull() which indicates that we are free to emit a single element. There is another callback, onDownstreamFinish() which is called if the downstream cancelled. Since the default behavior of that callback is to stop the operator, we don’t need to override it. In the onPull callback we will emit the next number. This is how it looks like in the end:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.stream.Attributes\nimport pekko.stream.Outlet\nimport pekko.stream.SourceShape\nimport pekko.stream.stage.GraphStage\nimport pekko.stream.stage.GraphStageLogic\nimport pekko.stream.stage.OutHandler\n\nclass NumbersSource extends GraphStage[SourceShape[Int]] {\n  val out: Outlet[Int] = Outlet(\"NumbersSource\")\n  override val shape: SourceShape[Int] = SourceShape(out)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic =\n    new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      // All state MUST be inside the GraphStageLogic,\n      // never inside the enclosing GraphStage.\n      // This state is safe to access and modify from all the\n      // callbacks that are provided by GraphStageLogic and the\n      // registered handlers.\n      private var counter = 1\n\n      setHandler(out,\n        new OutHandler {\n          override def onPull(): Unit = {\n            push(out, counter)\n            counter += 1\n          }\n        })\n    }\n}\nInstances of the above GraphStageGraphStage are subclasses of Graph[SourceShape[Int],NotUsed] Graph<SourceShape<Integer>,NotUsed> which means that they are already usable in many situations, but do not provide the DSL methods we usually have for other Source s. In order to convert this Graph to a proper Source we need to wrap it using Source.fromGraph (see Modularity, Composition and Hierarchy for more details about operators and DSLs). Now we can use the source as any other built-in one:\nScala copysource// A GraphStage is a proper Graph, just like what GraphDSL.create would return\nval sourceGraph: Graph[SourceShape[Int], NotUsed] = new NumbersSource\n\n// Create a Source from the Graph to access the DSL\nval mySource: Source[Int, NotUsed] = Source.fromGraph(sourceGraph)\n\n// Returns 55\nval result1: Future[Int] = mySource.take(10).runFold(0)(_ + _)\n\n// The source is reusable. This returns 5050\nval result2: Future[Int] = mySource.take(100).runFold(0)(_ + _) Java copysource// A GraphStage is a proper Graph, just like what GraphDSL.create would return\nGraph<SourceShape<Integer>, NotUsed> sourceGraph = new NumbersSource();\n\n// Create a Source from the Graph to access the DSL\nSource<Integer, NotUsed> mySource = Source.fromGraph(sourceGraph);\n\n// Returns 55\nCompletionStage<Integer> result1 =\n    mySource.take(10).runFold(0, (sum, next) -> sum + next, system);\n\n// The source is reusable. This returns 5050\nCompletionStage<Integer> result2 =\n    mySource.take(100).runFold(0, (sum, next) -> sum + next, system);\nSimilarly, to create a custom SinkSink one can register a subclass InHandlerInHandler with the operator InletInlet. The onPush()onPush() callback is used to signal the handler a new element has been pushed to the operator, and can hence be grabbed and used. onPush() can be overridden to provide custom behavior. Please note, most Sinks would need to request upstream elements as soon as they are created: this can be done by calling pull(inlet)pull(inlet) in the preStart()preStart() callback.\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.stream.Attributes\nimport pekko.stream.Inlet\nimport pekko.stream.SinkShape\nimport pekko.stream.stage.GraphStage\nimport pekko.stream.stage.GraphStageLogic\nimport pekko.stream.stage.InHandler\n\nclass StdoutSink extends GraphStage[SinkShape[Int]] {\n  val in: Inlet[Int] = Inlet(\"StdoutSink\")\n  override val shape: SinkShape[Int] = SinkShape(in)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic =\n    new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n\n      // This requests one element at the Sink startup.\n      override def preStart(): Unit = pull(in)\n\n      setHandler(in,\n        new InHandler {\n          override def onPush(): Unit = {\n            println(grab(in))\n            pull(in)\n          }\n        })\n    }\n} Java copysourcepublic class StdoutSink extends GraphStage<SinkShape<Integer>> {\n  public final Inlet<Integer> in = Inlet.create(\"StdoutSink.in\");\n\n  private final SinkShape<Integer> shape = SinkShape.of(in);\n\n  @Override\n  public SinkShape<Integer> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape()) {\n\n      // This requests one element at the Sink startup.\n      @Override\n      public void preStart() {\n        pull(in);\n      }\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() throws Exception {\n                Integer element = grab(in);\n                System.out.println(element);\n                pull(in);\n              }\n            });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}","title":"Custom processing with GraphStage"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html#port-states-and-","text":"In order to interact with a port (InletInlet or OutletOutlet) of the operator we need to be able to receive events and generate new events belonging to the port.","title":"Port states, InHandler AbstractInHandler and OutHandler AbstractOutHandler"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html#output-port","text":"From the GraphStageLogicGraphStageLogic the following operations are available on an output port:\npush(out,elem) pushes an element to the output port.

Demand flowing upstream leading to elements flowing downstream.\nTo illustrate these concepts we create a small GraphStage that implements the map transformation.\nMap calls push(out) from the onPush() handler and it also calls pull() from the onPull handler resulting in the conceptual wiring above, and fully expressed in code below:\nScala copysourceclass Map[A, B](f: A => B) extends GraphStage[FlowShape[A, B]] {\n\n  val in = Inlet[A](\"Map.in\")\n  val out = Outlet[B](\"Map.out\")\n\n  override val shape = FlowShape.of(in, out)\n\n  override def createLogic(attr: Attributes): GraphStageLogic =\n    new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      setHandler(in,\n        new InHandler {\n          override def onPush(): Unit = {\n            push(out, f(grab(in)))\n          }\n        })\n      setHandler(out,\n        new OutHandler {\n          override def onPull(): Unit = {\n            pull(in)\n          }\n        })\n    }\n} Java copysourcepublic class Map<A, B> extends GraphStage<FlowShape<A, B>> {\n\n  private final Function<A, B> f;\n\n  public Map(Function<A, B> f) {\n    this.f = f;\n  }\n\n  public final Inlet<A> in = Inlet.create(\"Map.in\");\n  public final Outlet<B> out = Outlet.create(\"Map.out\");\n\n  private final FlowShape<A, B> shape = FlowShape.of(in, out);\n\n  @Override\n  public FlowShape<A, B> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() throws Exception {\n                push(out, f.apply(grab(in)));\n              }\n            });\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                pull(in);\n              }\n            });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\nMap is a typical example of a one-to-one transformation of a stream where demand is passed along upstream elements passed on downstream.\nTo demonstrate a many-to-one operator we will implement filter. The conceptual wiring of Filter looks like this:\nAs we see above, if the given predicate matches the current element we are propagating it downwards, otherwise we return the “ball” to our upstream so that we get the new element. This is achieved by modifying the map example by adding a conditional in the onPush handler and decide between a pull(in) or push(out) call (and not having a mapping f function).\nScala copysourceclass Filter[A](p: A => Boolean) extends GraphStage[FlowShape[A, A]] {\n\n  val in = Inlet[A](\"Filter.in\")\n  val out = Outlet[A](\"Filter.out\")\n\n  val shape = FlowShape.of(in, out)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic =\n    new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      setHandler(in,\n        new InHandler {\n          override def onPush(): Unit = {\n            val elem = grab(in)\n            if (p(elem)) push(out, elem)\n            else pull(in)\n          }\n        })\n      setHandler(out,\n        new OutHandler {\n          override def onPull(): Unit = {\n            pull(in)\n          }\n        })\n    }\n} Java copysourcepublic final class Filter<A> extends GraphStage<FlowShape<A, A>> {\n\n  private final Predicate<A> p;\n\n  public Filter(Predicate<A> p) {\n    this.p = p;\n  }\n\n  public final Inlet<A> in = Inlet.create(\"Filter.in\");\n  public final Outlet<A> out = Outlet.create(\"Filter.out\");\n\n  private final FlowShape<A, A> shape = FlowShape.of(in, out);\n\n  @Override\n  public FlowShape<A, A> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() {\n                A elem = grab(in);\n                if (p.test(elem)) {\n                  push(out, elem);\n                } else {\n                  pull(in);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                pull(in);\n              }\n            });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\nTo complete the picture we define a one-to-many transformation as the next step. We chose a straightforward example operator that emits every upstream element twice downstream. The conceptual wiring of this operator looks like this:\nThis is an operator that has state: an option with the last element it has seen indicating if it has duplicated this last element already or not. We must also make sure to emit the extra element if the upstream completes.\nScala copysourceclass Duplicator[A] extends GraphStage[FlowShape[A, A]] {\n\n  val in = Inlet[A](\"Duplicator.in\")\n  val out = Outlet[A](\"Duplicator.out\")\n\n  val shape = FlowShape.of(in, out)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic =\n    new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      // Again: note that all mutable state\n      // MUST be inside the GraphStageLogic\n      var lastElem: Option[A] = None\n\n      setHandler(in,\n        new InHandler {\n          override def onPush(): Unit = {\n            val elem = grab(in)\n            lastElem = Some(elem)\n            push(out, elem)\n          }\n\n          override def onUpstreamFinish(): Unit = {\n            if (lastElem.isDefined) emit(out, lastElem.get)\n            complete(out)\n          }\n\n        })\n      setHandler(out,\n        new OutHandler {\n          override def onPull(): Unit = {\n            if (lastElem.isDefined) {\n              push(out, lastElem.get)\n              lastElem = None\n            } else {\n              pull(in)\n            }\n          }\n        })\n    }\n} Java copysourcepublic class Duplicator<A> extends GraphStage<FlowShape<A, A>> {\n\n  public final Inlet<A> in = Inlet.create(\"Duplicator.in\");\n  public final Outlet<A> out = Outlet.create(\"Duplicator.out\");\n\n  private final FlowShape<A, A> shape = FlowShape.of(in, out);\n\n  @Override\n  public FlowShape<A, A> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      // Again: note that all mutable state\n      // MUST be inside the GraphStageLogic\n      Option<A> lastElem = Option.none();\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() {\n                A elem = grab(in);\n                lastElem = Option.some(elem);\n                push(out, elem);\n              }\n\n              @Override\n              public void onUpstreamFinish() {\n                if (lastElem.isDefined()) {\n                  emit(out, lastElem.get());\n                }\n                complete(out);\n              }\n            });\n\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                if (lastElem.isDefined()) {\n                  push(out, lastElem.get());\n                  lastElem = Option.none();\n                } else {\n                  pull(in);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\nIn this case a pull from downstream might be consumed by the operator itself rather than passed along upstream as the operator might contain an element it wants to push. Note that we also need to handle the case where the upstream closes while the operator still has elements it wants to push downstream. This is done by overriding onUpstreamFinish in the InHandlerAbstractInHandler and provide custom logic that should happen when the upstream has been finished.\nThis example can be simplified by replacing the usage of a mutable state with calls to emitMultiple which will replace the handlers, emit each of multiple elements and then reinstate the original handlers:\nScala copysourceclass Duplicator[A] extends GraphStage[FlowShape[A, A]] {\n\n  val in = Inlet[A](\"Duplicator.in\")\n  val out = Outlet[A](\"Duplicator.out\")\n\n  val shape = FlowShape.of(in, out)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic =\n    new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n\n      setHandler(in,\n        new InHandler {\n          override def onPush(): Unit = {\n            val elem = grab(in)\n            // this will temporarily suspend this handler until the two elems\n            // are emitted and then reinstates it\n            emitMultiple(out, Iterable(elem, elem))\n          }\n        })\n      setHandler(out,\n        new OutHandler {\n          override def onPull(): Unit = {\n            pull(in)\n          }\n        })\n    }\n} Java copysourcepublic class Duplicator2<A> extends GraphStage<FlowShape<A, A>> {\n\n  public final Inlet<A> in = Inlet.create(\"Duplicator.in\");\n  public final Outlet<A> out = Outlet.create(\"Duplicator.out\");\n\n  private final FlowShape<A, A> shape = FlowShape.of(in, out);\n\n  @Override\n  public FlowShape<A, A> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() {\n                A elem = grab(in);\n                // this will temporarily suspend this handler until the two elems\n                // are emitted and then reinstates it\n                emitMultiple(out, Arrays.asList(elem, elem).iterator());\n              }\n            });\n\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                pull(in);\n              }\n            });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\nFinally, to demonstrate all of the operators above, we put them together into a processing chain, which conceptually would correspond to the following structure:\nIn code this is only a few lines, using the viavia use our custom operators in a stream:\nScala copysourceval resultFuture =\n  Source(1 to 5).via(new Filter(_ % 2 == 0)).via(new Duplicator()).via(new Map(_ / 2)).runWith(sink)\n Java copysourceCompletionStage<String> resultFuture =\n    Source.from(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n        .via(new Filter<Integer>((n) -> n % 2 == 0))\n        .via(new Duplicator<Integer>())\n        .via(new Map<Integer, Integer>((n) -> n / 2))\n        .runWith(sink, system);\nIf we attempt to draw the sequence of events, it shows that there is one “event token” in circulation in a potential chain of operators, just like our conceptual “railroad tracks” representation predicts.","title":"Custom linear operators using GraphStage"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html#completion","text":"Completion handling usually (but not exclusively) comes into the picture when operators need to emit a few more elements after their upstream source has been completed. We have seen an example of this in our first Duplicator implementation where the last element needs to be doubled even after the upstream neighbor operator has been completed. This can be done by overriding the onUpstreamFinish method in InHandlerAbstractInHandler.\nOperators by default automatically stop once all of their ports (input and output) have been closed externally or internally. It is possible to opt out from this behavior by invoking setKeepGoing(true) (which is not supported from the operator’s constructor and usually done in preStart). In this case the operator must be explicitly closed by calling completeStage()completeStage() or `failStage(exception)failStage(exception).

The callback can safely access the state of the GraphStageLogicGraphStageLogic implementation.\nSharing the AsyncCallback from the constructor risks race conditions, therefore it is recommended to use the preStart() lifecycle hook instead.\nThis example shows an asynchronous side channel operator that starts dropping elements when a future completes:\nScala copysource// will close upstream in all materializations of the graph stage instance\n// when the future completes\nclass KillSwitch[A](switch: Future[Unit]) extends GraphStage[FlowShape[A, A]] {\n\n  val in = Inlet[A](\"KillSwitch.in\")\n  val out = Outlet[A](\"KillSwitch.out\")\n\n  val shape = FlowShape.of(in, out)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic =\n    new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n\n      override def preStart(): Unit = {\n        val callback = getAsyncCallback[Unit] { _ =>\n          completeStage()\n        }\n        switch.foreach(callback.invoke)\n      }\n\n      setHandler(in,\n        new InHandler {\n          override def onPush(): Unit = { push(out, grab(in)) }\n        })\n      setHandler(out,\n        new OutHandler {\n          override def onPull(): Unit = { pull(in) }\n        })\n    }\n} Java copysource// will close upstream in all materializations of the stage instance\n// when the completion stage completes\npublic class KillSwitch<A> extends GraphStage<FlowShape<A, A>> {\n\n  private final CompletionStage<Done> switchF;\n\n  public KillSwitch(CompletionStage<Done> switchF) {\n    this.switchF = switchF;\n  }\n\n  public final Inlet<A> in = Inlet.create(\"KillSwitch.in\");\n  public final Outlet<A> out = Outlet.create(\"KillSwitch.out\");\n\n  private final FlowShape<A, A> shape = FlowShape.of(in, out);\n\n  @Override\n  public FlowShape<A, A> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() {\n                push(out, grab(in));\n              }\n            });\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                pull(in);\n              }\n            });\n      }\n\n      @Override\n      public void preStart() {\n        AsyncCallback<Done> callback =\n            createAsyncCallback(\n                new Procedure<Done>() {\n                  @Override\n                  public void apply(Done param) throws Exception {\n                    completeStage();\n                  }\n                });\n\n        ExecutionContext ec = system.dispatcher();\n        switchF.thenAccept(callback::invoke);\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}","title":"Using asynchronous side-channels"},{"location":"/stream/stream-customize.html#integration-with-actors","text":"This section is a stub and will be extended in the next release This is a may change feature*\nIt is possible to acquire an ActorRef that can be addressed from the outside of the operator, similarly how AsyncCallbackAsyncCallback allows injecting asynchronous events into an operator logic.

One immediate consequence of this difference is that an onPush call does not always lead to calling push and an onPull call does not always lead to calling pull.\nOne of the important use-case for this is to build buffer-like entities, that allow independent progress of upstream and downstream operators when the buffer is not full or empty, and slowing down the appropriate side if the buffer becomes empty or full.\nThe next diagram illustrates the event sequence for a buffer with capacity of two elements in a setting where the downstream demand is slow to start and the buffer will fill up with upstream elements before any demand is seen from downstream.\nAnother scenario would be where the demand from downstream starts coming in before any element is pushed into the buffer operator.\nThe first difference we can notice is that our Buffer operator is automatically pulling its upstream on initialization.

The reason for this is that when the operator itself completes or is failed there is no signal from the upstreams or the downstreams. Even for operators that do not complete or fail in this manner, this can happen when the MaterializerMaterializer is shutdown or the ActorSystemActorSystem is terminated while a stream is still running, what is called an “abrupt termination”.\nExtending Flow Operators with Custom Operators The most general way of extending any SourceSource, FlowFlow or SubFlowSubFlow (e.g. from groupBy) is demonstrated above: create an operator of flow-shape like the Duplicator example given above and use the .via(...).via(...) operator to integrate it into your stream topology. This works with all FlowOps sub-types, including the ports that you connect with the graph DSL. Advanced Scala users may wonder whether it is possible to write extension methods that enrich FlowOps to allow nicer syntax. The short answer is that Scala 2 does not support this in a fully generic fashion, the problem is that it is impossible to abstract over the kind of stream that is being extended because Source, Flow and SubFlow differ in the number and kind of their type parameters. While it would be possible to write an implicit class that enriches them generically, this class would require explicit instantiation with all type parameters due to SI-2712. For a partial workaround that unifies extensions to Source and Flow see this sketch by R. Kuhn. A lot simpler is the task of adding an extension method to Source as shown below: copysourceimplicit class SourceDuplicator[Out, Mat](s: Source[Out, Mat]) {\n  def duplicateElements: Source[Out, Mat] = s.via(new Duplicator)\n}\n\nval s = Source(1 to 3).duplicateElements\n\ns.runWith(Sink.seq).futureValue should ===(Seq(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)) The analog works for Flow as well: copysourceimplicit class FlowDuplicator[In, Out, Mat](s: Flow[In, Out, Mat]) {\n  def duplicateElements: Flow[In, Out, Mat] = s.via(new Duplicator)\n}\n\nval f = Flow[Int].duplicateElements\n\nSource(1 to 3).via(f).runWith(Sink.seq).futureValue should ===(Seq(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)) If you try to write this for SubFlow, though, you will run into the same issue as when trying to unify the two solutions above, only on a higher level (the type constructors needed for that unification would have rank two, meaning that some of their type arguments are type constructors themselves—when trying to extend the solution shown in the linked sketch the author encountered such a density of compiler StackOverflowErrors and IDE failures that he gave up). It is interesting to note that a simplified form of this problem has found its way into the dotty test suite. Dotty is the development version of Scala on its way to Scala 3.","title":"Resources and the operator lifecycle"},{"location":"/stream/futures-interop.html","text":"","title":"Futures interop"},{"location":"/stream/futures-interop.html#futures-interop","text":"","title":"Futures interop"},{"location":"/stream/futures-interop.html#dependency","text":"To use Pekko Streams, add the module to your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-stream\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-stream_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-stream_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/stream/futures-interop.html#overview","text":"Stream transformations and side effects involving external non-stream based services can be performed with mapAsync or mapAsyncUnordered.\nFor example, sending emails to the authors of selected tweets using an external email service:\nScala copysourcedef send(email: Email): Future[Unit] = {\n  // ...\n} Java copysourcepublic CompletionStage<Email> send(Email email) {\n  // ...\n}\nWe start with the tweet stream of authors:\nScala copysourceval authors: Source[Author, NotUsed] =\n  tweets.filter(_.hashtags.contains(pekkoTag)).map(_.author) Java copysourcefinal Source<Author, NotUsed> authors =\n    tweets.filter(t -> t.hashtags().contains(PEKKO)).map(t -> t.author);\nAssume that we can look up their email address using:\nScala copysourcedef lookupEmail(handle: String): Future[Option[String]] = Java copysourcepublic CompletionStage<Optional<String>> lookupEmail(String handle)\nTransforming the stream of authors to a stream of email addresses by using the lookupEmail service can be done with mapAsync:\nScala copysourceval emailAddresses: Source[String, NotUsed] =\n  authors.mapAsync(4)(author => addressSystem.lookupEmail(author.handle)).collect {\n    case Some(emailAddress) => emailAddress\n  } Java copysourcefinal Source<String, NotUsed> emailAddresses =\n    authors\n        .mapAsync(4, author -> addressSystem.lookupEmail(author.handle))\n        .filter(o -> o.isPresent())\n        .map(o -> o.get());\nFinally, sending the emails:\nScala copysourceval sendEmails: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] =\n  emailAddresses\n    .mapAsync(4)(address => {\n      emailServer.send(Email(to = address, title = \"pekko\", body = \"I like your tweet\"))\n    })\n    .to(Sink.ignore)\n\nsendEmails.run() Java copysourcefinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> sendEmails =\n    emailAddresses\n        .mapAsync(\n            4,\n            address -> emailServer.send(new Email(address, \"PEKKO\", \"I like your tweet\")))\n        .to(Sink.ignore());\n\nsendEmails.run(system);\nmapAsync is applying the given function that is calling out to the external service to each of the elements as they pass through this processing step.

These Futures may complete in any order, but the elements that are emitted downstream are in the same order as received from upstream.\nThat means that back-pressure works as expected. For example if the emailServer.send is the bottleneck it will limit the rate at which incoming tweets are retrieved and email addresses looked up.\nThe final piece of this pipeline is to generate the demand that pulls the tweet authors information through the emailing pipeline: we attach a Sink.ignore which makes it all run. If our email process would return some interesting data for further transformation then we would not ignore it but send that result stream onwards for further processing or storage.\nNote that mapAsync preserves the order of the stream elements. In this example the order is not important and then we can use the more efficient mapAsyncUnordered:\nScala copysourceval authors: Source[Author, NotUsed] =\n  tweets.filter(_.hashtags.contains(pekkoTag)).map(_.author)\n\nval emailAddresses: Source[String, NotUsed] =\n  authors.mapAsyncUnordered(4)(author => addressSystem.lookupEmail(author.handle)).collect {\n    case Some(emailAddress) => emailAddress\n  }\n\nval sendEmails: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] =\n  emailAddresses\n    .mapAsyncUnordered(4)(address => {\n      emailServer.send(Email(to = address, title = \"Pekko\", body = \"I like your tweet\"))\n    })\n    .to(Sink.ignore)\n\nsendEmails.run() Java copysourcefinal Source<Author, NotUsed> authors =\n    tweets.filter(t -> t.hashtags().contains(PEKKO)).map(t -> t.author);\n\nfinal Source<String, NotUsed> emailAddresses =\n    authors\n        .mapAsyncUnordered(4, author -> addressSystem.lookupEmail(author.handle))\n        .filter(o -> o.isPresent())\n        .map(o -> o.get());\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> sendEmails =\n    emailAddresses\n        .mapAsyncUnordered(\n            4,\n            address -> emailServer.send(new Email(address, \"Pekko\", \"I like your tweet\")))\n        .to(Sink.ignore());\n\nsendEmails.run(system);\nIn the above example the services conveniently returned a FutureCompletionStage of the result. If that is not the case you need to wrap the call in a FutureCompletionStage. If the service call involves blocking you must also make sure that you run it on a dedicated execution context, to avoid starvation and disturbance of other tasks in the system.\nScala copysourceval blockingExecutionContext = system.dispatchers.lookup(\"blocking-dispatcher\")\n\nval sendTextMessages: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] =\n  phoneNumbers\n    .mapAsync(4)(phoneNo => {\n      Future {\n        smsServer.send(TextMessage(to = phoneNo, body = \"I like your tweet\"))\n      }(blockingExecutionContext)\n    })\n    .to(Sink.ignore)\n\nsendTextMessages.run() Java copysourcefinal Executor blockingEc = system.dispatchers().lookup(\"blocking-dispatcher\");\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> sendTextMessages =\n    phoneNumbers\n        .mapAsync(\n            4,\n            phoneNo ->\n                CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(\n                    () -> smsServer.send(new TextMessage(phoneNo, \"I like your tweet\")),\n                    blockingEc))\n        .to(Sink.ignore());\n\nsendTextMessages.run(system);\nThe configuration of the \"blocking-dispatcher\" may look something like:\ncopysourceblocking-dispatcher {\n  executor = \"thread-pool-executor\"\n  thread-pool-executor {\n    core-pool-size-min    = 10\n    core-pool-size-max    = 10\n  }\n}\nAn alternative for blocking calls is to perform them in a map operation, still using a dedicated dispatcher for that operation.\nScala copysourceval send = Flow[String]\n  .map { phoneNo =>\n    smsServer.send(TextMessage(to = phoneNo, body = \"I like your tweet\"))\n  }\n  .withAttributes(ActorAttributes.dispatcher(\"blocking-dispatcher\"))\nval sendTextMessages: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] =\n  phoneNumbers.via(send).to(Sink.ignore)\n\nsendTextMessages.run() Java copysourcefinal Flow<String, Boolean, NotUsed> send =\n    Flow.of(String.class)\n        .map(phoneNo -> smsServer.send(new TextMessage(phoneNo, \"I like your tweet\")))\n        .withAttributes(ActorAttributes.dispatcher(\"blocking-dispatcher\"));\nfinal RunnableGraph<?> sendTextMessages = phoneNumbers.via(send).to(Sink.ignore());\n\nsendTextMessages.run(system);\nHowever, that is not exactly the same as mapAsync, since the mapAsync may run several calls concurrently, but map performs them one at a time.\nFor a service that is exposed as an actor, or if an actor is used as a gateway in front of an external service, you can use ask:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.pattern.ask\n\nval PekkoTweets: Source[Tweet, NotUsed] = tweets.filter(_.hashtags.contains(pekkoTag))\n\nimplicit val timeout: Timeout = 3.seconds\nval saveTweets: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] =\n  PekkoTweets.mapAsync(4)(tweet => database ? Save(tweet)).to(Sink.ignore) Java copysourcefinal Source<Tweet, NotUsed> pekkoTweets = tweets.filter(t -> t.hashtags().contains(PEKKO));\n\nfinal RunnableGraph<NotUsed> saveTweets =\n    pekkoTweets\n        .mapAsync(4, tweet -> ask(database, new Save(tweet), Duration.ofMillis(300L)))\n        .to(Sink.ignore());\nNote that if the ask is not completed within the given timeout the stream is completed with failure. If that is not desired outcome you can use recover on the ask FutureCompletionStage.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"/stream/futures-interop.html#illustrating-ordering-and-parallelism","text":"Let us look at another example to get a better understanding of the ordering and parallelism characteristics of mapAsync and mapAsyncUnordered.\nSeveral mapAsync and mapAsyncUnordered futures may run concurrently. The number of concurrent futures are limited by the downstream demand. For example, if 5 elements have been requested by downstream there will be at most 5 futures in progress.\nmapAsync emits the future results in the same order as the input elements were received. That means that completed results are only emitted downstream when earlier results have been completed and emitted. One slow call will thereby delay the results of all successive calls, even though they are completed before the slow call.\nmapAsyncUnordered emits the future results as soon as they are completed, i.e. it is possible that the elements are not emitted downstream in the same order as received from upstream. One slow call will thereby not delay the results of faster successive calls as long as there is downstream demand of several elements.\nHere is a fictive service that we can use to illustrate these aspects.\nScala copysourceclass SometimesSlowService(implicit ec: ExecutionContext) {\n\n  private val runningCount = new AtomicInteger\n\n  def convert(s: String): Future[String] = {\n    println(s\"running: $s (${runningCount.incrementAndGet()})\")\n    Future {\n      if (s.nonEmpty && s.head.isLower)\n        Thread.sleep(500)\n      else\n        Thread.sleep(20)\n      println(s\"completed: $s (${runningCount.decrementAndGet()})\")\n      s.toUpperCase\n    }\n  }\n} Java copysourcestatic class SometimesSlowService {\n  private final Executor ec;\n\n  public SometimesSlowService(Executor ec) {\n    this.ec = ec;\n  }\n\n  private final AtomicInteger runningCount = new AtomicInteger();\n\n  public CompletionStage<String> convert(String s) {\n    System.out.println(\"running: \" + s + \"(\" + runningCount.incrementAndGet() + \")\");\n    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(\n        () -> {\n          if (!s.isEmpty() && Character.isLowerCase(s.charAt(0)))\n            try {\n              Thread.sleep(500);\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            }\n          else\n            try {\n              Thread.sleep(20);\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            }\n          System.out.println(\"completed: \" + s + \"(\" + runningCount.decrementAndGet() + \")\");\n          return s.toUpperCase();\n        },\n        ec);\n  }\n}\nElements starting with a lower case character are simulated to take longer time to process.\nHere is how we can use it with mapAsync:\nScala copysourceimplicit val blockingExecutionContext = system.dispatchers.lookup(\"blocking-dispatcher\")\nval service = new SometimesSlowService\n\nSource(List(\"a\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"e\", \"F\", \"g\", \"H\", \"i\", \"J\"))\n  .map(elem => { println(s\"before: $elem\"); elem })\n  .mapAsync(4)(service.convert)\n  .to(Sink.foreach(elem => println(s\"after: $elem\")))\n  .withAttributes(Attributes.inputBuffer(initial = 4, max = 4))\n  .run() Java copysourcefinal Executor blockingEc = system.dispatchers().lookup(\"blocking-dispatcher\");\nfinal SometimesSlowService service = new SometimesSlowService(blockingEc);\n\nSource.from(Arrays.asList(\"a\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"e\", \"F\", \"g\", \"H\", \"i\", \"J\"))\n    .map(\n        elem -> {\n          System.out.println(\"before: \" + elem);\n          return elem;\n        })\n    .mapAsync(4, service::convert)\n    .to(Sink.foreach(elem -> System.out.println(\"after: \" + elem)))\n    .withAttributes(Attributes.inputBuffer(4, 4))\n    .run(system);\nThe output may look like this:\nbefore: a\nbefore: B\nbefore: C\nbefore: D\nrunning: a (1)\nrunning: B (2)\nbefore: e\nrunning: C (3)\nbefore: F\nrunning: D (4)\nbefore: g\nbefore: H\ncompleted: C (3)\ncompleted: B (2)\ncompleted: D (1)\ncompleted: a (0)\nafter: A\nafter: B\nrunning: e (1)\nafter: C\nafter: D\nrunning: F (2)\nbefore: i\nbefore: J\nrunning: g (3)\nrunning: H (4)\ncompleted: H (2)\ncompleted: F (3)\ncompleted: e (1)\ncompleted: g (0)\nafter: E\nafter: F\nrunning: i (1)\nafter: G\nafter: H\nrunning: J (2)\ncompleted: J (1)\ncompleted: i (0)\nafter: I\nafter: J\nNote that after lines are in the same order as the before lines even though elements are completed in a different order.

For the Java 9 and later built in interfaces there is a separate set of factories in org.apache.pekko.stream.scaladsl.JavaFlowSupportorg.apache.pekko.stream.javadsl.JavaFlowSupport.\nIn the following samples the standalone Reactive Stream API factories has been used but each such call can be replaced with the corresponding method from JavaFlowSupport and the JDK java.util.concurrent.Flow._java.util.concurrent.Flow.* interfaces.\nNote that it is not possible to use JavaFlowSupport on Java 8 since the needed interfaces simply is not available in the Java standard library.\nThe two most important interfaces in Reactive Streams are the Publisher and Subscriber.\nScala copysourceimport org.reactivestreams.Publisher\nimport org.reactivestreams.Subscriber\nimport org.reactivestreams.Processor Java copysourceimport org.reactivestreams.Publisher;\nimport org.reactivestreams.Subscriber;\nimport org.reactivestreams.Processor;\nLet us assume that a library provides a publisher of tweets:\nScala copysourcedef tweets: Publisher[Tweet] Java copysourcePublisher<Tweet> tweets();\nand another library knows how to store author handles in a database:\nScala copysourcedef storage: Subscriber[Author] Java copysourceSubscriber<Author> storage();\nUsing a Pekko Streams Flow we can transform the stream and connect those:\nScala copysourceval authors = Flow[Tweet].filter(_.hashtags.contains(pekkoTag)).map(_.author)\n\nSource.fromPublisher(tweets).via(authors).to(Sink.fromSubscriber(storage)).run() Java copysourcefinal Flow<Tweet, Author, NotUsed> authors =\n    Flow.of(Tweet.class).filter(t -> t.hashtags().contains(PEKKO)).map(t -> t.author);\n\nSource.fromPublisher(rs.tweets()).via(authors).to(Sink.fromSubscriber(rs.storage()));\nThe Publisher is used as an input Source to the flow and the Subscriber is used as an output Sink.\nA Flow can also be converted to a RunnableGraph[Processor[In, Out]] which materializes to a Processor when run() is called. run() itself can be called multiple times, resulting in a new Processor instance each time.\nScala copysourceval processor: Processor[Tweet, Author] = authors.toProcessor.run()\n\ntweets.subscribe(processor)\nprocessor.subscribe(storage) Java copysourcefinal Processor<Tweet, Author> processor = authors.toProcessor().run(system);\n\nrs.tweets().subscribe(processor);\nprocessor.subscribe(rs.storage());\nA publisher can be connected to a subscriber with the subscribe method.\nIt is also possible to expose a Source as a Publisher by using the Publisher-Sink:\nScala copysourceval authorPublisher: Publisher[Author] =\n  Source.fromPublisher(tweets).via(authors).runWith(Sink.asPublisher(fanout = false))\n\nauthorPublisher.subscribe(storage) Java copysourcefinal Publisher<Author> authorPublisher =\n    Source.fromPublisher(rs.tweets())\n        .via(authors)\n        .runWith(Sink.asPublisher(AsPublisher.WITHOUT_FANOUT), system);\n\nauthorPublisher.subscribe(rs.storage());\nA publisher that is created with Sink.asPublisher(fanout = false)Sink.asPublisher(AsPublisher.WITHOUT_FANOUT) supports only a single subscription.

One of the prime examples when this is useful is when a WebSocket connection fails due to the HTTP server it’s running on going down, perhaps because it is overloaded. By using an exponential backoff, we avoid going into a tight reconnect loop, which both gives the HTTP server some time to recover, and it avoids using needless resources on the client side.\nThe various restart shapes mentioned all expect an RestartSettingsRestartSettings which configures the restart behaviour. Configurable parameters are:\nminBackoff is the initial duration until the underlying stream is restarted maxBackoff caps the exponential backoff randomFactor allows addition of a random delay following backoff calculation maxRestarts caps the total number of restarts maxRestartsWithin sets a timeframe during which restarts are counted towards the same total for maxRestarts\nThe following snippet shows how to create a backoff supervisor using RestartSourceRestartSource which will supervise the given SourceSource. The Source in this case is a stream of Server Sent Events, produced by pekko-http. If the stream fails or completes at any point, the request will be made again, in increasing intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24 and finally 30 seconds (at which point it will remain capped due to the maxBackoff parameter):\nScala copysourceval settings = RestartSettings(\n  minBackoff = 3.seconds,\n  maxBackoff = 30.seconds,\n  randomFactor = 0.2 // adds 20% \"noise\" to vary the intervals slightly\n).withMaxRestarts(20, 5.minutes) // limits the amount of restarts to 20 within 5 minutes\n\nval restartSource = RestartSource.withBackoff(settings) { () =>\n  // Create a source from a future of a source\n  Source.futureSource {\n    // Make a single request with pekko-http\n    Http()\n      .singleRequest(HttpRequest(uri = \"http://example.com/eventstream\"))\n      // Unmarshall it as a source of server sent events\n      .flatMap(Unmarshal(_).to[Source[ServerSentEvent, NotUsed]])\n  }\n} Java copysourceRestartSettings settings =\n    RestartSettings.create(\n            Duration.ofSeconds(3), // min backoff\n            Duration.ofSeconds(30), // max backoff\n            0.2 // adds 20% \"noise\" to vary the intervals slightly\n            )\n        .withMaxRestarts(\n            20, Duration.ofMinutes(5)); // limits the amount of restarts to 20 within 5 minutes\n\nSource<ServerSentEvent, NotUsed> eventStream =\n    RestartSource.withBackoff(\n        settings,\n        () ->\n            // Create a source from a future of a source\n            Source.completionStageSource(\n                // Issue a GET request on the event stream\n                Http.get(system)\n                    .singleRequest(HttpRequest.create(\"http://example.com/eventstream\"))\n                    .thenCompose(\n                        response ->\n                            // Unmarshall it to a stream of ServerSentEvents\n                            EventStreamUnmarshalling.fromEventStream()\n                                .unmarshall(response, materializer))));\nUsing a randomFactor to add a little bit of additional variance to the backoff intervals is highly recommended, in order to avoid multiple streams re-start at the exact same point in time, for example because they were stopped due to a shared resource such as the same server going down and re-starting after the same configured interval. By adding additional randomness to the re-start intervals the streams will start in slightly different points in time, thus avoiding large spikes of traffic hitting the recovering server or other resource that they all need to contact.\nThe above RestartSource will never terminate unless the SinkSink it’s fed into cancels. It will often be handy to use it in combination with a KillSwitch, so that you can terminate it when needed:\nScala copysourceval killSwitch = restartSource\n  .viaMat(KillSwitches.single)(Keep.right)\n  .toMat(Sink.foreach(event => println(s\"Got event: $event\")))(Keep.left)\n  .run()\n\ndoSomethingElse()\n\nkillSwitch.shutdown() Java copysourceKillSwitch killSwitch =\n    eventStream\n        .viaMat(KillSwitches.single(), Keep.right())\n        .toMat(Sink.foreach(event -> System.out.println(\"Got event: \" + event)), Keep.left())\n        .run(materializer);\n\ndoSomethingElse();\n\nkillSwitch.shutdown();\nSinks and flows can also be supervised, using RestartSinkRestartSink and RestartFlowRestartFlow. The RestartSink is restarted when it cancels, while the RestartFlow is restarted when either the in port cancels, the out port completes, or the out port sends an error.\nNote Care should be taken when using GraphStages that conditionally propagate termination signals inside a RestartSourceRestartSource, RestartSinkRestartSink or RestartFlowRestartFlow. An example is a Broadcast operator with the default eagerCancel = false where some of the outlets are for side-effecting branches (that do not re-join e.g. via a Merge). A failure on a side branch will not terminate the supervised stream which will not be restarted. Conversely, a failure on the main branch can trigger a restart but leave behind old running instances of side branches. In this example eagerCancel should probably be set to true, or, when only a single side branch is used, alsoTo or divertTo should be considered as alternatives.","title":"Delayed restarts with a backoff operator"},{"location":"/stream/stream-error.html#supervision-strategies","text":"Note The operators that support supervision strategies are explicitly documented to do so, if there is nothing in the documentation of an operator saying that it adheres to the supervision strategy it means it fails rather than applies supervision.\nThe error handling strategies are inspired by actor supervision strategies, but the semantics have been adapted to the domain of stream processing. The most important difference is that supervision is not automatically applied to stream operators but instead something that each operator has to implement explicitly.\nFor many operators it may not even make sense to implement support for supervision strategies, this is especially true for operators connecting to external technologies where for example a failed connection will likely still fail if a new connection is tried immediately (see Restart with back off for such scenarios).\nFor operators that do implement supervision, the strategies for how to handle exceptions from processing stream elements can be selected when materializing the stream through use of an attribute.\nThere are three ways to handle exceptions from application code:\nStopSupervision.stop() - The stream is completed with failure. ResumeSupervision.resume() - The element is dropped and the stream continues. RestartSupervision.restart() - The element is dropped and the stream continues after restarting the operator. Restarting an operator means that any accumulated state is cleared. This is typically performed by creating a new instance of the operator.\nBy default the stopping strategy is used for all exceptions, i.e. the stream will be completed with failure when an exception

Since one ByteString does not have to necessarily correspond to exactly one line of text (the client might be sending the line in chunks) we use the Framing.delimiterFraming.delimiter helper Flow to chunk the inputs up into actual lines of text.

It is also possible to shut down the server’s socket by cancelling the IncomingConnectionIncomingConnection source connections.\nWe can then test the TCP server by sending data to the TCP Socket using netcat:\n$ echo -n \"Hello World\" | netcat 127.0.0.1 8888\nHello World!!!","title":"Accepting connections: Echo Server"},{"location":"/stream/stream-io.html#connecting-repl-client","text":"In this example we implement a rather naive Read Evaluate Print Loop client over TCP.

Then we connect the TCP pipeline to this operator–at this point it will be materialized and start processing data once the server responds with an initial message.\nA resilient REPL client would be more sophisticated than this, for example it should split out the input reading into a separate mapAsync step and have a way to let the server write more data than one ByteString chunk at any given time, these improvements however are left as exercise for the reader.","title":"Connecting: REPL Client"},{"location":"/stream/stream-io.html#avoiding-deadlocks-and-liveness-issues-in-back-pressured-cycles","text":"When writing such end-to-end back-pressured systems you may sometimes end up in a situation of a loop, in which either side is waiting for the other one to start the conversation. One does not need to look far to find examples of such back-pressure loops. In the two examples shown previously, we always assumed that the side we are connecting to would start the conversation, which effectively means both sides are back-pressured and can not get the conversation started. There are multiple ways of dealing with this which are explained in depth in Graph cycles, liveness and deadlocks, however in client-server scenarios it is often the simplest to make either side send an initial message.\nNote In case of back-pressured cycles (which can occur even between different systems) sometimes you have to decide which of the sides has start the conversation in order to kick it off. This can be often done by injecting an initial message from one of the sides–a conversation starter.\nTo break this back-pressure cycle we need to inject some initial message, a “conversation starter”. First, we need to decide which side of the connection should remain passive and which active. Thankfully in most situations finding the right spot to start the conversation is rather simple, as it often is inherent to the protocol we are trying to implement using Streams.

This means that the API or semantics can change without warning or deprecation period, and it is not recommended to use this module in production just yet.\nStream references, or “stream refs” for short, allow running Pekko Streams across multiple nodes within a Pekko Cluster.\nUnlike heavier “streaming data processing” frameworks, Pekko Streams are neither “deployed” nor automatically distributed. Pekko stream refs are, as the name implies, references to existing parts of a stream, and can be used to create a distributed processing framework or to introduce such capabilities in specific parts of your application.\nStream refs are trivial to use in existing clustered Pekko applications and require no additional configuration or setup. They automatically maintain flow-control / back-pressure over the network and employ Pekko’s failure detection mechanisms to fail-fast (“let it crash!”) in the case of failures of remote nodes. They can be seen as an implementation of the Work Pulling Pattern, which one would otherwise implement manually.\nNote A useful way to think about stream refs is: “like an ActorRef, but for Pekko Streams’s Source and Sink”. Stream refs refer to an already existing, possibly remote, Sink or Source. This is not to be mistaken with deploying streams remotely, which this feature is not intended for.\nIMPORTANT Use stream refs with Pekko Cluster. The failure detector can cause quarantining if plain Pekko remoting is used.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/stream/stream-refs.html#stream-references","text":"The prime use case for stream refs is to replace raw actor or HTTP messaging in systems that expect long-running streams of data between two entities. Often they can be used to effectively achieve point-to-point streaming without the need to set up additional message brokers or similar secondary clusters.\nStream refs are well-suited for any system in which you need to send messages between nodes in a flow-controlled fashion. Typical examples include sending work requests to worker nodes as fast as possible, but not faster than the worker nodes can process them, or sending data elements that the downstream may be slow at processing. It is recommended to mix and introduce stream refs in actor-messaging-based systems, where the actor messaging is used to orchestrate and prepare such message flows, and later the stream refs are used to do the flow-controlled message transfer.\nStream refs are not persistent. However, it is simple to build a resumable stream by introducing such a protocol in the actor messaging layer. Stream refs are absolutely expected to be sent over Pekko remoting to other nodes within a cluster using Pekko Cluster, and therefore complement, instead of compete, with plain Actor messaging. Actors would usually be used to establish the stream via some initial message saying, “I want to offer you many log elements (the stream ref),” or conversely, “if you need to send me much data, here is the stream ref you can use to do so”.\nSince the two sides (“local” and “remote”) of each reference may be confusing to refer to as “remote” and “local” – since either side can be seen as “local” or “remote” depending how we look at it – we propose using the terminology “origin” and “target”, which is defined by where the stream ref was created. For SourceRefs, the “origin” is the side which has the data that it is going to stream out. For SinkRefs, the “origin” side is the actor system that is ready to receive the data and has allocated the ref. Those two may be seen as duals of each other.

As an effect, most of the time there are two pancakes being cooked at the same time, one being cooked on its first side and the second being cooked to completion.

One drawback is that if the processing times of the operators are very different then some of the operators will not be able to operate at full throughput because they will wait on a previous or subsequent operator most of the time. In the pancake example frying the second half of the pancake is usually faster than frying the first half, fryingPan2 will not be able to operate at full capacity [1].\nNote Asynchronous stream operators have internal buffers to make communication between them more efficient.

This is how this setup will look like if implemented using streams:\nScala copysourceval fryingPan: Flow[ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed] =\n  Flow[ScoopOfBatter].map { batter =>\n    Pancake()\n  }\n\nval pancakeChef: Flow[ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed] = Flow.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n  val dispatchBatter = builder.add(Balance[ScoopOfBatter](2))\n  val mergePancakes = builder.add(Merge[Pancake](2))\n\n  // Using two frying pans in parallel, both fully cooking a pancake from the batter.\n  // We always put the next scoop of batter to the first frying pan that becomes available.\n  dispatchBatter.out(0) ~> fryingPan.async ~> mergePancakes.in(0)\n  // Notice that we used the \"fryingPan\" flow without importing it via builder.add().\n  // Flows used this way are auto-imported, which in this case means that the two\n  // uses of \"fryingPan\" mean actually different stages in the graph.\n  dispatchBatter.out(1) ~> fryingPan.async ~> mergePancakes.in(1)\n\n  FlowShape(dispatchBatter.in, mergePancakes.out)\n})\n Java copysourceFlow<ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed> fryingPan =\n    Flow.of(ScoopOfBatter.class).map(batter -> new Pancake());\n\nFlow<ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed> pancakeChef =\n    Flow.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            b -> {\n              final UniformFanInShape<Pancake, Pancake> mergePancakes = b.add(Merge.create(2));\n              final UniformFanOutShape<ScoopOfBatter, ScoopOfBatter> dispatchBatter =\n                  b.add(Balance.create(2));\n\n              // Using two frying pans in parallel, both fully cooking a pancake from the\n              // batter.\n              // We always put the next scoop of batter to the first frying pan that becomes\n              // available.\n              b.from(dispatchBatter.out(0))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergePancakes.in(0));\n              // Notice that we used the \"fryingPan\" flow without importing it via\n              // builder.add().\n              // Flows used this way are auto-imported, which in this case means that the two\n              // uses of \"fryingPan\" mean actually different stages in the graph.\n              b.from(dispatchBatter.out(1))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergePancakes.in(1));\n\n              return FlowShape.of(dispatchBatter.in(), mergePancakes.out());\n            }));\nThe benefit of parallelizing is that it is easy to scale. In the pancake example it is easy to add a third frying pan with Patrik’s method, but Roland cannot add a third frying pan, since that would require a third processing step, which is not practically possible in the case of frying pancakes.\nOne drawback of the example code above is it does not preserve the ordering of pancakes. This might be a problem if children like to track their “own” pancakes. In those cases the BalanceBalance and MergeMerge operators should be replaced by round-robin balancing and merging operators which put in and take out pancakes in a strict order.\nA more detailed example of creating a worker pool can be found in the cookbook: Balancing jobs to a fixed pool of workers","title":"Parallel processing"},{"location":"/stream/stream-parallelism.html#combining-pipelining-and-parallel-processing","text":"The two concurrency patterns that we demonstrated as means to increase throughput are not exclusive. In fact, it is rather simple to combine the two approaches and streams provide a nice unifying language to express and compose them.\nFirst, let’s look at how we can parallelize pipelined operators. In the case of pancakes this means that we will employ two chefs, each working using Roland’s pipelining method, but we use the two chefs in parallel, just like Patrik used the two frying pans. This is how it looks like if expressed as streams:\nScala copysourceval pancakeChef: Flow[ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed] =\n  Flow.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n    val dispatchBatter = builder.add(Balance[ScoopOfBatter](2))\n    val mergePancakes = builder.add(Merge[Pancake](2))\n\n    // Using two pipelines, having two frying pans each, in total using\n    // four frying pans\n    dispatchBatter.out(0) ~> fryingPan1.async ~> fryingPan2.async ~> mergePancakes.in(0)\n    dispatchBatter.out(1) ~> fryingPan1.async ~> fryingPan2.async ~> mergePancakes.in(1)\n\n    FlowShape(dispatchBatter.in, mergePancakes.out)\n  }) Java copysourceFlow<ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed> pancakeChef =\n    Flow.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            b -> {\n              final UniformFanInShape<Pancake, Pancake> mergePancakes = b.add(Merge.create(2));\n              final UniformFanOutShape<ScoopOfBatter, ScoopOfBatter> dispatchBatter =\n                  b.add(Balance.create(2));\n\n              // Using two pipelines, having two frying pans each, in total using\n              // four frying pans\n              b.from(dispatchBatter.out(0))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan1.async()))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan2.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergePancakes.in(0));\n\n              b.from(dispatchBatter.out(1))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan1.async()))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan2.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergePancakes.in(1));\n\n              return FlowShape.of(dispatchBatter.in(), mergePancakes.out());\n            }));\nThe above pattern works well if there are many independent jobs that do not depend on the results of each other, but the jobs themselves need multiple processing steps where each step builds on the result of the previous one. In our case individual pancakes do not depend on each other, they can be cooked in parallel, on the other hand it is not possible to fry both sides of the same pancake at the same time, so the two sides have to be fried in sequence.\nIt is also possible to organize parallelized operators into pipelines. This would mean employing four chefs:\nthe first two chefs prepare half-cooked pancakes from batter, in parallel, then putting those on a large enough flat surface. the second two chefs take these and fry their other side in their own pans, then they put the pancakes on a shared plate.\nThis is again straightforward to implement with the streams API:\nScala copysourceval pancakeChefs1: Flow[ScoopOfBatter, HalfCookedPancake, NotUsed] =\n  Flow.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n    val dispatchBatter = builder.add(Balance[ScoopOfBatter](2))\n    val mergeHalfPancakes = builder.add(Merge[HalfCookedPancake](2))\n\n    // Two chefs work with one frying pan for each, half-frying the pancakes then putting\n    // them into a common pool\n    dispatchBatter.out(0) ~> fryingPan1.async ~> mergeHalfPancakes.in(0)\n    dispatchBatter.out(1) ~> fryingPan1.async ~> mergeHalfPancakes.in(1)\n\n    FlowShape(dispatchBatter.in, mergeHalfPancakes.out)\n  })\n\nval pancakeChefs2: Flow[HalfCookedPancake, Pancake, NotUsed] =\n  Flow.fromGraph(GraphDSL.create() { implicit builder =>\n    val dispatchHalfPancakes = builder.add(Balance[HalfCookedPancake](2))\n    val mergePancakes = builder.add(Merge[Pancake](2))\n\n    // Two chefs work with one frying pan for each, finishing the pancakes then putting\n    // them into a common pool\n    dispatchHalfPancakes.out(0) ~> fryingPan2.async ~> mergePancakes.in(0)\n    dispatchHalfPancakes.out(1) ~> fryingPan2.async ~> mergePancakes.in(1)\n\n    FlowShape(dispatchHalfPancakes.in, mergePancakes.out)\n  })\n\nval kitchen: Flow[ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed] = pancakeChefs1.via(pancakeChefs2) Java copysourceFlow<ScoopOfBatter, HalfCookedPancake, NotUsed> pancakeChefs1 =\n    Flow.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            b -> {\n              final UniformFanInShape<HalfCookedPancake, HalfCookedPancake> mergeHalfCooked =\n                  b.add(Merge.create(2));\n              final UniformFanOutShape<ScoopOfBatter, ScoopOfBatter> dispatchBatter =\n                  b.add(Balance.create(2));\n\n              // Two chefs work with one frying pan for each, half-frying the pancakes then\n              // putting\n              // them into a common pool\n              b.from(dispatchBatter.out(0))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan1.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergeHalfCooked.in(0));\n              b.from(dispatchBatter.out(1))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan1.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergeHalfCooked.in(1));\n\n              return FlowShape.of(dispatchBatter.in(), mergeHalfCooked.out());\n            }));\n\nFlow<HalfCookedPancake, Pancake, NotUsed> pancakeChefs2 =\n    Flow.fromGraph(\n        GraphDSL.create(\n            b -> {\n              final UniformFanInShape<Pancake, Pancake> mergePancakes = b.add(Merge.create(2));\n              final UniformFanOutShape<HalfCookedPancake, HalfCookedPancake>\n                  dispatchHalfCooked = b.add(Balance.create(2));\n\n              // Two chefs work with one frying pan for each, finishing the pancakes then\n              // putting\n              // them into a common pool\n              b.from(dispatchHalfCooked.out(0))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan2.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergePancakes.in(0));\n              b.from(dispatchHalfCooked.out(1))\n                  .via(b.add(fryingPan2.async()))\n                  .toInlet(mergePancakes.in(1));\n\n              return FlowShape.of(dispatchHalfCooked.in(), mergePancakes.out());\n            }));\n\nFlow<ScoopOfBatter, Pancake, NotUsed> kitchen = pancakeChefs1.via(pancakeChefs2);\nThis usage pattern is less common but might be usable if a certain step in the pipeline might take wildly different times to finish different jobs. The reason is that there are more balance-merge steps in this pattern compared to the parallel pipelines. This pattern rebalances after each step, while the previous pattern only balances at the entry point of the pipeline. This only matters however if the processing time distribution has a large deviation.\n[1] Roland’s reason for this seemingly suboptimal procedure is that he prefers the temperature of the second pan to be slightly lower than the first in order to achieve a more homogeneous result.","title":"Combining pipelining and parallel processing"},{"location":"/stream/stream-testkit.html","text":"","title":"Testing streams"},{"location":"/stream/stream-testkit.html#testing-streams","text":"","title":"Testing streams"},{"location":"/stream/stream-testkit.html#dependency","text":"To use Pekko Stream TestKit, add the module to your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-stream-testkit\" % PekkoVersion % Test Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-stream-testkit_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  testImplementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-stream-testkit_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/stream/stream-testkit.html#introduction","text":"Verifying behavior of Pekko Stream sources, flows and sinks can be done using various code patterns and libraries.

Given a stream of words we first create a new stream that groups the words according to the identity i -> i function, i.e. now we have a stream of streams, where every substream will serve identical words.\nTo count the words, we need to process the stream of streams (the actual groups containing identical words). groupBy returns a SubFlow SubSource, which means that we transform the resulting substreams directly. In this case we use the reduce operator to aggregate the word itself and the number of its occurrences within a tuple (String, Integer) Pair<String, Integer>. Each substream will then emit one final value—precisely such a pair—when the overall input completes. As a last step we merge back these values from the substreams into one single output stream.\nOne noteworthy detail pertains to the MaximumDistinctWords MAXIMUM_DISTINCT_WORDS parameter: this defines the breadth of the groupBy and merge operations. Pekko Streams is focused on bounded resource consumption and the number of concurrently open inputs to the merge operator describes the amount of resources needed by the merge itself. Therefore only a finite number of substreams can be active at any given time.

The downstream onPull handler is very similar, we immediately relieve the downstream by emitting currentValue.\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.stream._\nimport pekko.stream.stage._\nfinal class HoldWithInitial[T](initial: T) extends GraphStage[FlowShape[T, T]] {\n  val in = Inlet[T](\"HoldWithInitial.in\")\n  val out = Outlet[T](\"HoldWithInitial.out\")\n\n  override val shape = FlowShape.of(in, out)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic = new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n    private var currentValue: T = initial\n\n    setHandlers(in, out,\n      new InHandler with OutHandler {\n        override def onPush(): Unit = {\n          currentValue = grab(in)\n          pull(in)\n        }\n\n        override def onPull(): Unit = {\n          push(out, currentValue)\n        }\n      })\n\n    override def preStart(): Unit = {\n      pull(in)\n    }\n  }\n\n} Java copysourceclass HoldWithInitial<T> extends GraphStage<FlowShape<T, T>> {\n\n  public Inlet<T> in = Inlet.<T>create(\"HoldWithInitial.in\");\n  public Outlet<T> out = Outlet.<T>create(\"HoldWithInitial.out\");\n  private FlowShape<T, T> shape = FlowShape.of(in, out);\n\n  private final T initial;\n\n  public HoldWithInitial(T initial) {\n    this.initial = initial;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public FlowShape<T, T> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      private T currentValue = initial;\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() throws Exception {\n                currentValue = grab(in);\n                pull(in);\n              }\n            });\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                push(out, currentValue);\n              }\n            });\n      }\n\n      @Override\n      public void preStart() {\n        pull(in);\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\nWhile it is relatively simple, the drawback of the first version is that it needs an arbitrary initial element which is not always possible to provide. Hence, we create a second version where the downstream might need to wait in one single case: if the very first element is not yet available.\nWe introduce a boolean variable waitingFirstValue to denote whether the first element has been provided or not (alternatively an Option Optional can be used for currentValue or if the element type is a subclass of AnyRef Object a null can be used with the same purpose). In the downstream onPull() handler the difference from the previous version is that we check if we have received the first value and only emit if we have. This leads to that when the first element comes in we must check if there possibly already was demand from downstream so that we in that case can push the element directly.\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.stream._\nimport pekko.stream.stage._\nfinal class HoldWithWait[T] extends GraphStage[FlowShape[T, T]] {\n  val in = Inlet[T](\"HoldWithWait.in\")\n  val out = Outlet[T](\"HoldWithWait.out\")\n\n  override val shape = FlowShape.of(in, out)\n\n  override def createLogic(inheritedAttributes: Attributes): GraphStageLogic = new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n    private var currentValue: T = _\n    private var waitingFirstValue = true\n\n    setHandlers(\n      in,\n      out,\n      new InHandler with OutHandler {\n        override def onPush(): Unit = {\n          currentValue = grab(in)\n          if (waitingFirstValue) {\n            waitingFirstValue = false\n            if (isAvailable(out)) push(out, currentValue)\n          }\n          pull(in)\n        }\n\n        override def onPull(): Unit = {\n          if (!waitingFirstValue) push(out, currentValue)\n        }\n      })\n\n    override def preStart(): Unit = {\n      pull(in)\n    }\n  }\n} Java copysourceclass HoldWithWait<T> extends GraphStage<FlowShape<T, T>> {\n  public Inlet<T> in = Inlet.<T>create(\"HoldWithInitial.in\");\n  public Outlet<T> out = Outlet.<T>create(\"HoldWithInitial.out\");\n  private FlowShape<T, T> shape = FlowShape.of(in, out);\n\n  @Override\n  public FlowShape<T, T> shape() {\n    return shape;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public GraphStageLogic createLogic(Attributes inheritedAttributes) {\n    return new GraphStageLogic(shape) {\n      private T currentValue = null;\n      private boolean waitingFirstValue = true;\n\n      {\n        setHandler(\n            in,\n            new AbstractInHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPush() throws Exception {\n                currentValue = grab(in);\n                if (waitingFirstValue) {\n                  waitingFirstValue = false;\n                  if (isAvailable(out)) push(out, currentValue);\n                }\n                pull(in);\n              }\n            });\n        setHandler(\n            out,\n            new AbstractOutHandler() {\n              @Override\n              public void onPull() throws Exception {\n                if (!waitingFirstValue) push(out, currentValue);\n              }\n            });\n      }\n\n      @Override\n      public void preStart() {\n        pull(in);\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}","title":"Create a stream processor that repeats the last element seen"},{"location":"/stream/stream-cookbook.html#globally-limiting-the-rate-of-a-set-of-streams","text":"Situation: Given a set of independent streams that we cannot merge, we want to globally limit the aggregate throughput of the set of streams.\nOne possible solution uses a shared actor as the global limiter combined with mapAsync to create a reusable Flow that can be plugged into a stream to limit its rate.\nAs the first step we define an actor that will do the accounting for the global rate limit. The actor maintains a timer, a counter for pending permit tokens and a queue for possibly waiting participants. The actor has an open and closed state. The actor is in the open state while it has still pending permits. Whenever a request for permit arrives as a WantToPass message to the actor the number of available permits is decremented and we notify the sender that it can pass by answering with a MayPass message. If the amount of permits reaches zero, the actor transitions to the closed state. In this state requests are not immediately answered, instead the reference of the sender is added to a queue. Once the timer for replenishing the pending permits fires by sending a ReplenishTokens message, we increment the pending permits counter and send a reply to each of the waiting senders.

During backoff, this FlowFlow will backpressure.\nThis uses the same exponential backoff algorithm as BackoffOptsBackoffOpts.\nSee also:\nRestartSource.withBackoff RestartSource.onFailuresWithBackoff RestartFlow.withBackoff RestartSink.withBackoff","title":"Description"},{"location":"/stream/operators/RestartFlow/onFailuresWithBackoff.html#reactive-streams-semantics","text":"emits when the wrapped flow emits backpressures during backoff and when the wrapped flow backpressures completes when the wrapped flow completes or maxRestarts are reached within the given time limit","title":"Reactive Streams semantics"},{"location":"/stream/operators/Source-or-Flow/orElse.html","text":"","title":"orElse"},{"location":"/stream/operators/Source-or-Flow/orElse.html#orelse","text":"If the primary source completes without emitting any elements, the elements from the secondary source are emitted.\nFan-in operators","title":"orElse"},{"location":"/stream/operators/Source-or-Flow/orElse.html#signature","text":"Source.orElseSource.orElse Flow.orElseFlow.orElse","title":"Signature"},{"location":"/stream/operators/Source-or-Flow/orElse.html#description","text":"If the primary source completes without emitting any elements, the elements from the secondary source are emitted.

The BoundedSourceQueue will give immediate, synchronous feedback whether an element was accepted or not and is therefore recommended for situations where overload and dropping elements is expected and needs to be handled quickly.\nIn contrast, the SourceQueue offers more variety of OverflowStrategies but feedback is only asynchronously provided through a FutureCompletionStage value. In cases where elements need to be discarded quickly at times of overload to avoid out-of-memory situations, delivering feedback asynchronously can itself become a problem. This happens if elements come in faster than the feedback can be delivered in which case the feedback mechanism itself is part of the reason that an out-of-memory situation arises.\nIn summary, prefer BoundedSourceQueue over SourceQueue with OverflowStrategy.dropNew especially in high-load scenarios. Use SourceQueue if you need one of the other OverflowStrategies.\nThe BoundedSourceQueue contains a buffer that can be used by many producers on different threads. When the buffer is full, the BoundedSourceQueue will not accept more elements. The return value of BoundedSourceQueue.offer() immediately returns a QueueOfferResult (as opposed to an asynchronous value returned by SourceQueue).

When a client connects and request a video content, the server should return the content.

It can be improved by sending more content than the necessary ahead of time and let the client buffer that. So, throttle can be used to burst the first 30 seconds and then send a constant of 24 frames per second. This way, when a request comes in a good chunk of content will be downloaded and after that the server will activate the throttling.\nScala copysource// val frameSource: Source[Frame,_]\nval videoThrottlingWithBurst = frameSource.throttle(\n  framesPerSecond,\n  1.second,\n  framesPerSecond * 30, // maximumBurst\n  ThrottleMode.Shaping)\n// serialize `Frame` and send over the network.

Alternatively we could set the throttling mode to cause a stream failure when upstream is faster than the throttle rate.\nThe examples above don’t cover all the parameters supported by throttle (e.g. cost-based throttling).

The parameter to setLoggerName can be a String or a Class, where the latter is convenience for the class name.\nWhen logging via the ActorContext the path of the actor will automatically be added as pekkoSource Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) value. MDC is typically implemented with a ThreadLocal by the SLF4J backend. To reduce performance impact, this MDC value is set when you access the loggetLog() method so you shouldn’t cache the returned Logger in your own field. That is handled by ActorContext and retrieving the Logger repeatedly with the loggetLog method has low overhead. The MDC is cleared automatically after processing of current message has finished.\nNote The Logger is thread-safe but the loggetLog method in ActorContext is not thread-safe and should not be accessed from threads other than the ordinary actor message processing thread, such as FutureCompletionStage callbacks.\nIt’s also perfectly fine to use a Logger retrieved via org.slf4j.LoggerFactory, but then the logging events will not include the pekkoSource MDC value. This is the recommended way when logging outside of an actor, including logging from FutureCompletionStage callbacks.\nScala copysourceval log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"com.myservice.BackendTask\")\n\nFuture {\n  // some work\n  \"result\"\n}.onComplete {\n  case Success(result) => log.info(\"Task completed: {}\", result)\n  case Failure(exc)    => log.error(\"Task failed\", exc)\n} Java copysourceclass BackendTask {\n  private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());\n\n  void run() {\n    CompletableFuture<String> task =\n        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(\n            () -> {\n              // some work\n              return \"result\";\n            });\n    task.whenComplete(\n        (result, exc) -> {\n          if (exc == null) log.error(\"Task failed\", exc);\n          else log.info(\"Task completed: {}\", result);\n        });\n  }\n}","title":"How to log"},{"location":"/typed/logging.html#placeholder-arguments","text":"The log message may contain argument placeholders {}, which will be substituted if the log level is enabled. Compared to constructing a full string for the log message this has the advantage of avoiding superfluous string concatenation and object allocations when the log level is disabled. Some logging backends may also use these message templates before argument substitution to group and filter logging events.\nIt can be good to know that 3 or more arguments will result in the relatively small cost of allocating an array (vararg parameter) also when the log level is disabled. The methods with 1 or 2 arguments don’t allocate the vararg array.\nWhen using the methods for 2 argument placeholders the compiler will often not be able to select the right method and report compiler error “ambiguous reference to overloaded definition”.

It doesn’t block the threads of the ActorSystemActorSystem while the underlying infrastructure writes the log messages to disk or other configured destination.

These should be used in conjunction with judicious timeouts at the interfaces between remote systems to prevent the failure of a single component from bringing down all components.\nAs an example, we have a web application interacting with a remote third party web service. Let’s say the third party has oversold their capacity and their database melts down under load. Assume that the database fails in such a way that it takes a very long time to hand back an error to the third party web service. This in turn makes calls fail after a long period of time. Back to our web application, the users have noticed that their form submissions take much longer seeming to hang. Well the users do what they know to do which is use the refresh button, adding more requests to their already running requests. This eventually causes the failure of the web application due to resource exhaustion. This will affect all users, even those who are not using functionality dependent on this third party web service.\nIntroducing circuit breakers on the web service call would cause the requests to begin to fail-fast, letting the user know that something is wrong and that they need not refresh their request. This also confines the failure behavior to only those users that are using functionality dependent on the third party, other users are no longer affected as there is no resource exhaustion. Circuit breakers can also allow savvy developers to mark portions of the site that use the functionality unavailable, or perhaps show some cached content as appropriate while the breaker is open.\nThe Apache Pekko library provides an implementation of a circuit breaker called CircuitBreakerCircuitBreaker which has the behavior described below.","title":"Why are they used?"},{"location":"/common/circuitbreaker.html#what-do-they-do-","text":"During normal operation, a circuit breaker is in the Closed state: Exceptions or calls exceeding the configured callTimeout increment a failure counter Successes reset the failure count to zero When the failure counter reaches a maxFailures count, the breaker is tripped into Open state While in Open state: All calls fail-fast with a CircuitBreakerOpenExceptionCircuitBreakerOpenException After the configured resetTimeout, the circuit breaker enters a Half-Open state In Half-Open state: The first call attempted is allowed through without failing fast All other calls fail-fast with an exception just as in Open state If the first call succeeds, the breaker is reset back to Closed state and the resetTimeout is reset If the first call fails, the breaker is tripped again into the Open state (as for exponential backoff circuit breaker, the resetTimeout is multiplied by the exponential backoff factor) State transition listeners: Callbacks can be provided for every state entry via onOpenonOpen, onCloseonClose, and onHalfOpenonHalfOpen These are executed in the ExecutionContext provided.

When an old node is stopped the shards that were running on it are moved to one of the other remaining nodes in the cluster when messages are sent to those shards.\nTo make rolling updates as smooth as possible there is a configuration property that defines the version of the application. This is used by rolling update features to distinguish between old and new nodes. For example, the default LeastShardAllocationStrategy avoids allocating shards to old nodes during a rolling update. The LeastShardAllocationStrategy sees that there is rolling update in progress when there are members with different configured app-version.\nTo make use of this feature you need to define the app-version and increase it for each rolling update.\npekko.cluster.app-version = 1.2.3\nTo understand which is old and new it compares the version numbers using normal conventions, see VersionVersion for more details.\nRebalance is also disabled during rolling updates, since shards from stopped nodes are anyway supposed to be started on new nodes. Messages to shards that were stopped on the old nodes will allocate corresponding shards on the new nodes, without waiting for rebalance actions.\nYou should also enable the health check for Cluster Sharding if you use Pekko Management. The readiness check will delay incoming traffic to the node until Sharding has been initialized and can accept messages.\nThe ShardCoordinator is itself a cluster singleton.

It has similar capabilities as Project Jigsaw (originally scheduled for JDK 1.8), but has far stronger facilities to support legacy Java code. This is to say that while Jigsaw-ready modules require significant changes to most source files and on occasion to the structure of the overall application, OSGi can be used to modularize almost any Java code as far back as JDK 1.2, usually with no changes at all to the binaries.\nThese legacy capabilities are OSGi’s major strength and its major weakness. The creators of OSGi realized early on that implementors would be unlikely to rush to support OSGi metadata in existing JARs. There were already a handful of new concepts to learn in the JRE and the added value to teams that were managing well with straight J2EE was not obvious. Facilities emerged to “wrap” binary JARs so they could be used as bundles, but this functionality was only used in limited situations. An application of the “80/20 Rule” here would have that “80% of the complexity is with 20% of the configuration”, but it was enough to give OSGi a reputation that has stuck with it to this day.\nThis document aims to the productivity basics folks need to use it with Pekko, the 20% that users need to get 80% of what they want. For more information than is provided here, OSGi In Action is worth exploring.","title":"Background"},{"location":"/additional/osgi.html#core-components-and-structure-of-osgi-applications","text":"The fundamental unit of deployment in OSGi is the Bundle. A bundle is a Java JAR with additional entries https://docs.osgi.org/reference/bundle-headers.html in MANIFEST.MF that minimally expose the name and version of the bundle and packages for import and export. Since these manifest entries are ignored outside OSGi deployments, a bundle can interchangeably be used as a JAR in the JRE.\nWhen a bundle is loaded, a specialized implementation of the Java ClassLoader is instantiated for each bundle. Each classloader reads the manifest entries and publishes both capabilities (in the form of the Bundle-Exports) and requirements (as Bundle-Imports) in a container singleton for discovery by other bundles. The process of matching imports to exports across bundles through these classloaders is the process of resolution, one of six discrete steps in the lifecycle FSM of a bundle in an OSGi container:\nINSTALLED: A bundle that is installed has been loaded from disk and a classloader instantiated with its capabilities. Bundles are iteratively installed manually or through container-specific descriptors. For those familiar with legacy packging such as EJB, the modular nature of OSGi means that bundles may be used by multiple applications with overlapping dependencies. By resolving them individually from repositories, these overlaps can be de-duplicated across multiple deployments to the same container. RESOLVED: A bundle that has been resolved is one that has had its requirements (imports) satisfied. Resolution does mean that a bundle can be started. STARTING: A bundle that is started can be used by other bundles. For an otherwise complete application closure of resolved bundles, the implication here is they must be started in the order directed by a depth-first search for all to be started. When a bundle is starting, any exposed lifecycle interfaces in the bundle are called, giving the bundle the opportunity to start its own service endpoints and threads. ACTIVE: Once a bundle’s lifecycle interfaces return without error, a bundle is marked as active. STOPPING: A bundle that is stopping is in the process of calling the bundle’s stop lifecycle and transitions back to the RESOLVED state when complete. Any long running services or threads that were created while STARTING should be shut down when the bundle’s stop lifecycle is called. UNINSTALLED: A bundle can only transition to this state from the INSTALLED state, meaning it cannot be uninstalled before it is stopped.\nNote the dependency in this FSM on lifecycle interfaces. While there is no requirement that a bundle publishes these interfaces or accepts such callbacks, the lifecycle interfaces provide the semantics of a main() method and allow the bundle to start and stop long-running services such as REST web services, ActorSystems, Clusters, etc.\nSecondly, note when considering requirements and capabilities, it’s a common misconception to equate these with repository dependencies as might be found in Maven or Ivy. While they provide similar practical functionality, OSGi has several parallel type of dependency (such as Blueprint Services) that cannot be easily mapped to repository capabilities. In fact, the core specification leaves these facilities up to the container in use. In turn, some containers have tooling to generate application load descriptors from repository metadata.","title":"Core Components and Structure of OSGi Applications"},{"location":"/additional/osgi.html#notable-behavior-changes","text":"Combined with understanding the bundle lifecycle, the OSGi developer must pay attention to sometimes unexpected behaviors that are introduced. These are generally within the JVM specification, but are unexpected and can lead to frustration.\nBundles should not export overlapping package spaces. It is not uncommon for legacy JVM frameworks to expect plugins in an application composed of multiple JARs to reside under a single package name. For example, a frontend application might scan all classes from com.example.plugins for specific service implementations with that package existing in several contributed JARs. While it is possible to support overlapping packages with complex manifest headers, it’s much better to use non-overlapping package spaces and facilities such as Pekko Cluster for service discovery. Stylistically, many organizations opt to use the root package path as the name of the bundle distribution file. Resources are not shared across bundles unless they are explicitly exported, as with classes. The common case of this is expecting that getClass().getClassLoader().getResources(\"foo\") will return all files on the classpath named foo. The getResources() method only returns resources from the current classloader, and since there are separate classloaders for every bundle, resource files such as configurations are no longer searchable in this manner.","title":"Notable Behavior Changes"},{"location":"/additional/osgi.html#configuring-the-osgi-framework","text":"To use Pekko in an OSGi environment, the container must be configured such that the org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation property delegates the sun.misc package to the boot classloader instead of resolving it through the normal OSGi class space.","title":"Configuring the OSGi Framework"},{"location":"/additional/osgi.html#intended-use","text":"Pekko only supports the usage of an ActorSystem strictly confined to a single OSGi bundle, where that bundle contains or imports all of the actor system’s requirements.

It alleviates the developer from having to deal with explicit locking and thread management, making it easier to write correct concurrent and parallel systems. Actors were defined in the 1973 paper by Carl Hewitt but have been popularized by the Erlang language and used for example at Ericsson with great success to build highly concurrent and reliable telecom systems.\nThe API of Pekko’s Actors is similar to Scala Actors which has borrowed some of its syntax from Erlang.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/actors.html#creating-actors","text":"Note Since Pekko enforces parental supervision every actor is supervised and (potentially) the supervisor of its children, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with Actor Systems, supervision and handling exceptions as well as Actor References, Paths and Addresses.","title":"Creating Actors"},{"location":"/actors.html#defining-an-actor-class","text":"Actors are implemented by extending the Actor base trait and implementing the receive method. The receive method should define a series of case statements (which has the type PartialFunction[Any, Unit]) that define which messages your Actor can handle, using standard Scala pattern matching, along with the implementation of how the messages should be processed.\nActor classes are implemented by extending the AbstractActor class and setting the “initial behavior” in the createReceive method. The createReceive method has no arguments and returns AbstractActor.Receive. It defines which messages your Actor can handle, along with the implementation of how the messages should be processed. You can build such behavior with a builder named ReceiveBuilder. This build has a convenient factory in AbstractActor called receiveBuilder.\nHere is an example:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.Actor\nimport pekko.actor.Props\nimport pekko.event.Logging\n\nclass MyActor extends Actor {\n  val log = Logging(context.system, this)\n\n  def receive = {\n    case \"test\" => log.info(\"received test\")\n    case _      => log.info(\"received unknown message\")\n  }\n} Java copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.actor.AbstractActor;\nimport org.apache.pekko.event.Logging;\nimport org.apache.pekko.event.LoggingAdapter;\n\npublic class MyActor extends AbstractActor {\n  private final LoggingAdapter log = Logging.getLogger(getContext().getSystem(), this);\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(\n            String.class,\n            s -> {\n              log.info(\"Received String message: {}\", s);\n            })\n        .matchAny(o -> log.info(\"received unknown message\"))\n        .build();\n  }\n}\nPlease note that the Pekko Actor receive message loop is exhaustive, which is different compared to Erlang and the late Scala Actors. This means that you need to provide a pattern match for all messages that it can accept and if you want to be able to handle unknown messages then you need to have a default case as in the example above. Otherwise an UnhandledMessageUnhandledMessage will be published to the ActorSystemActorSystem’s EventStreamEventStream.\nNote further that the return type of the behavior defined above is Unit; if the actor shall reply to the received message then this must be done explicitly as explained below.\nThe result of the receive method is a partial function object, which is createReceive method is AbstractActor.Receive which is a wrapper around partial scala function object. It is stored within the actor as its “initial behavior”, see Become/Unbecome for further information on changing the behavior of an actor after its construction.\nHere is another example that you can edit and run in the browser: import org.apache.pekko.actor.{ Actor, ActorRef, ActorSystem, PoisonPill, Props }\nimport language.postfixOps\nimport scala.concurrent.duration._\n\ncase object Ping\ncase object Pong\n\nclass Pinger extends Actor {\n  var countDown = 100\n\n  def receive = {\n    case Pong =>\n      println(s\"${self.path} received pong, count down $countDown\")\n\n      if (countDown > 0) {\n        countDown -= 1\n        sender() !

On the other hand, using this variant in a Props factory in the actor’s companion object as documented under “Recommended Practices” below is completely fine.\nThere were two use-cases for these methods: passing constructor arguments to the actor—which is solved by the newly introduced Props.apply(clazz, args) Props.create(clazz, args) method above or the recommended practice below—and creating actors “on the spot” as anonymous classes. The latter should be solved by making these actors named classes instead (if they are not declared within a top-level object then the enclosing instance’s this reference needs to be passed as the first argument).\nWarning Declaring one actor within another is very dangerous and breaks actor encapsulation.

The AbstractActorAbstractActor class defines a method called createReceive, that is used to set the “initial behavior” of the actor.

As long as the incarnation is the same, you can keep using the same ActorRefActorRef. Restart is handled by the Supervision Strategy of actor’s parent actor, and there is more discussion about what restart means.\nThe lifecycle of an incarnation ends when the actor is stopped. At that point, the appropriate lifecycle events are called and watching actors are notified of the termination. After the incarnation is stopped, the path can be reused again by creating an actor with actorOf(). In this case, the name of the new incarnation will be the same as the previous one, but the UIDs will differ. An actor can be stopped by the actor itself, another actor or the ActorSystemActorSystem (see Stopping actors).\nNote It is important to note that Actors do not stop automatically when no longer referenced, every Actor that is created must also explicitly be destroyed. The only simplification is that stopping a parent Actor will also recursively stop all the child Actors that this parent has created.\nAn ActorRefActorRef always represents an incarnation (path and UID) not just a given path. Therefore, if an actor is stopped, and a new one with the same name is created then an ActorRef of the old incarnation will not point to the new one.\nActorSelectionActorSelection on the other hand points to the path (or multiple paths if wildcards are used) and is completely oblivious to which incarnation is currently occupying it. ActorSelection cannot be watched for this reason.

Exceptions are sending messages using the At-Least-Once Delivery facility initiating the first contact with a remote system In all other cases, ActorRefs can be provided during Actor creation or initialization, passing them from parent to child or introducing Actors by sending their ActorRefs to other Actors within messages.\nThe supplied path is parsed as a java.net.URI, which means that it is split on / into path elements. If the path starts with /, it is absolute and the look-up starts at the root guardian (which is the parent of \"/user\"); otherwise it starts at the current actor. If a path element equals .., the look-up will take a step “up” towards the supervisor of the currently traversed actor, otherwise it will step “down” to the named child. It should be noted that the .. in actor paths here always means the logical structure, i.e. the supervisor.\nThe path elements of an actor selection may contain wildcard patterns allowing for broadcasting of messages to that section:\nScala copysource// will look all children to serviceB with names starting with worker\ncontext.actorSelection(\"/user/serviceB/worker*\")\n// will look up all siblings beneath same supervisor\ncontext.actorSelection(\"../*\") Java copysource// will look all children to serviceB with names starting with worker\ngetContext().actorSelection(\"/user/serviceB/worker*\");\n// will look up all siblings beneath same supervisor\ngetContext().actorSelection(\"../*\");\nMessages can be sent via the ActorSelectionActorSelection and the path of the ActorSelection is looked up when delivering each message.

The ask operation involves creating an internal actor for handling this reply, which needs to have a timeout after which it is destroyed in order not to leak resources; see more below.\nWarning To complete the FutureCompletionStage with an exception you need to send an Status.FailureStatus.Failure message to the sender.

Here is an example:\nThe return type is AbstractActor.Receive that defines which messages your Actor can handle, along with the implementation of how the messages should be processed. You can build such behavior with a builder named receiveBuilder.

It’s recommended to delegate the actual work of the message processing to methods instead of defining a huge ReceiveBuilder with lots of code in each lambda. A well-structured actor can look like this: copysourcestatic class WellStructuredActor extends AbstractActor {\n\n  public static class Msg1 {}\n\n  public static class Msg2 {}\n\n  public static class Msg3 {}\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(Msg1.class, this::receiveMsg1)\n        .match(Msg2.class, this::receiveMsg2)\n        .match(Msg3.class, this::receiveMsg3)\n        .build();\n  }\n\n  private void receiveMsg1(Msg1 msg) {\n    // actual work\n  }\n\n  private void receiveMsg2(Msg2 msg) {\n    // actual work\n  }\n\n  private void receiveMsg3(Msg3 msg) {\n    // actual work\n  }\n} That has benefits such as: easier to see what kind of messages the actor can handle readable stack traces in case of exceptions works better with performance profiling tools Java HotSpot has a better opportunity for making optimizations The Receive can be implemented in other ways than using the ReceiveBuilder since in the end, it is just a wrapper around a Scala PartialFunction. In Java, you can implement PartialFunction by extending AbstractPartialFunction. For example, one could implement an adapter to Vavr Pattern Matching DSL. See the Pekko Vavr sample project for more details. If the validation of the ReceiveBuilder match logic turns out to be a bottleneck for some of your actors you can consider implementing it at a lower level by extending UntypedAbstractActor instead of AbstractActor. The partial functions created by the ReceiveBuilder consist of multiple lambda expressions for every match statement, where each lambda is referencing the code to be run. This is something that the JVM can have problems optimizing and the resulting code might not be as performant as the untyped version. When extending UntypedAbstractActor each message is received as an untyped Object and you have to inspect and cast it to the actual message type in other ways, like this: copysourcestatic class OptimizedActor extends UntypedAbstractActor {\n\n  public static class Msg1 {}\n\n  public static class Msg2 {}\n\n  public static class Msg3 {}\n\n  @Override\n  public void onReceive(Object msg) throws Exception {\n    if (msg instanceof Msg1) receiveMsg1((Msg1) msg);\n    else if (msg instanceof Msg2) receiveMsg2((Msg2) msg);\n    else if (msg instanceof Msg3) receiveMsg3((Msg3) msg);\n    else unhandled(msg);\n  }\n\n  private void receiveMsg1(Msg1 msg) {\n    // actual work\n  }\n\n  private void receiveMsg2(Msg2 msg) {\n    // actual work\n  }\n\n  private void receiveMsg3(Msg3 msg) {\n    // actual work\n  }\n}","title":"Receive messages"},{"location":"/actors.html#reply-to-messages","text":"If you want to have a handle for replying to a message, you can use sender getSender(), which gives you an ActorRef.

This procedure ensures that actor system sub-trees terminate in an orderly fashion, propagating the stop command to the leaves and collecting their confirmation back to the stopped supervisor.

It is typically invoked when handling the default case in the actor’s message handler to stash messages that aren’t handled by the other cases. It is illegal to stash the same message twice; to do so results in an IllegalStateException being thrown. The stash may also be bounded in which case invoking stash() may lead to a capacity violation, which results in a StashOverflowExceptionStashOverflowException. The capacity of the stash can be configured using the stash-capacity setting (an Int) of the mailbox’s configuration.\nInvoking unstashAll() enqueues messages from the stash to the actor’s mailbox until the capacity of the mailbox (if any) has been reached (note that messages from the stash are prepended to the mailbox). In case a bounded mailbox overflows, a MessageQueueAppendFailedException is thrown. The stash is guaranteed to be empty after calling unstashAll().\nThe stash is backed by a scala.collection.immutable.Vector. As a result, even a very large number of messages may be stashed without a major impact on performance.\nWarning Note that the Stash trait must be mixed into (a subclass of) the Actor trait before any trait/class that overrides the preRestart] callback. This means it’s not possible to write Actor with MyActor with Stash if MyActor overrides preRestart.\nNote that the stash is part of the ephemeral actor state, unlike the mailbox. Therefore, it should be managed like other parts of the actor’s state which have the same property.\nHowever, the Stash trait AbstractActorWithStash class implementation of preRestart will call unstashAll(). This means that before the actor restarts, it will transfer all stashed messages back to the actor’s mailbox.\nThe result of this is that when an actor is restarted, any stashed messages will be delivered to the new incarnation of the actor. This is usually the desired behavior.\nNote If you want to enforce that your actor can only work with an unbounded stash, then you should use the UnboundedStash trait AbstractActorWithUnboundedStash class instead.\nExtending Actors using PartialFunction chaining Sometimes, it can be useful to share common behavior among a few actors, or compose one actor’s behavior from multiple smaller functions. This is possible because an actor’s receivecreateReceive method returns an Actor.Receive, which is a type alias for PartialFunction[Any,Unit], and partial functions can be chained together using the PartialFunction#orElse method. You can chain as many functions as you need, however you should keep in mind that “first match” wins - which may be important when combining functions that both can handle the same type of message. For example, imagine you have a set of actors which are either Producers or Consumers, yet sometimes it makes sense to have an actor share both behaviors. This can be achieved without having to duplicate code by extracting the behaviors to traits and implementing the actor’s receive as a combination of these partial functions. copysource trait ProducerBehavior {\n  this: Actor =>\n\n  val producerBehavior: Receive = {\n    case GiveMeThings =>\n      sender() !

One of the potential issues is that messages might be lost when sent to remote actors. Also, publishing an ActorRefActorRef in an uninitialized state might lead to the condition that it receives a user message before the initialization has been done.","title":"Initialization via message passing"},{"location":"/supervision-classic.html","text":"","title":"Classic Supervision"},{"location":"/supervision-classic.html#classic-supervision","text":"This chapter outlines the concept behind the supervision in Pekko Classic, for the corresponding overview of the new APIs see supervision","title":"Classic Supervision"},{"location":"/supervision-classic.html#what-supervision-means","text":"Supervision describes a dependency relationship between actors: the supervisor delegates tasks to subordinates and therefore must respond to their failures. When a subordinate detects a failure (i.e. throws an exception), it suspends itself and all its subordinates and sends a message to its supervisor, signaling failure. Depending on the nature of the work to be supervised and the nature of the failure, the supervisor has a choice of the following four options:\nResume the subordinate, keeping its accumulated internal state Restart the subordinate, clearing out its accumulated internal state Stop the subordinate permanently Escalate the failure, thereby failing itself\nIt is important to always view an actor as part of a supervision hierarchy, which explains the existence of the fourth choice (as a supervisor also is subordinate to another supervisor higher up) and has implications on the first three: resuming an actor resumes all its subordinates, restarting an actor entails restarting all its subordinates (but see below for more details), similarly terminating an actor will also terminate all its subordinates. It should be noted that the default behavior of the preRestart hook of the Actor class is to terminate all its children before restarting, but this hook can be overridden; the recursive restart applies to all children left after this hook has been executed.\nEach supervisor is configured with a function translating all possible failure causes (i.e. exceptions) into one of the four choices given above; notably, this function does not take the failed actor’s identity as an input. It is quite easy to come up with examples of structures where this might not seem flexible enough, e.g. wishing for different strategies to be applied to different subordinates. At this point, it is vital to understand that supervision is about forming a recursive fault handling structure. If you try to do too much at one level, it will become hard to reason about, hence the recommended way, in this case, is to add a level of supervision.\nPekko implements a specific form called “parental supervision”. Actors can only be created by other actors—where the top-level actor is provided by the library—and each created actor is supervised by its parent. This restriction makes the formation of actor supervision hierarchies implicit and encourages sound design decisions. It should be noted that this also guarantees that actors cannot be orphaned or attached to supervisors from the outside, which might otherwise catch them unawares. Besides, this yields a natural and clean shutdown procedure for (sub-trees of) actor applications.\nWarning Supervision-related communication happens by special system messages that have their mailboxes separate from user messages. This implies that supervision related events are not deterministically ordered relative to ordinary messages. In general, the user cannot influence the order of normal messages and failure notifications. For details and example see the Discussion: Message Ordering section.","title":"What Supervision Means"},{"location":"/supervision-classic.html#the-top-level-supervisors","text":"An actor system will during its creation start at least three actors, shown in the image above.

Actors created using system.actorOf() are children of this actor. This means that when this guardian terminates, all normal actors in the system will be shutdown, too. It also means that this guardian’s supervisor strategy determines how the top-level normal actors are supervised. Since Pekko 2.1 it is possible to configure this using the setting pekko.actor.guardian-supervisor-strategy, which takes the fully-qualified class-name of a SupervisorStrategyConfigurator.

And because this means that it is “outside of the bubble”, it is called the “bubble-walker”. This is a synthetic ActorRef which in effect stops its child upon the first sign of trouble and sets the actor system’s isTerminated status to true as soon as the root guardian is fully terminated (all children recursively stopped).","title":"/: The Root Guardian"},{"location":"/supervision-classic.html#one-for-one-strategy-vs-all-for-one-strategy","text":"There are two classes of supervision strategies which come with Pekko: OneForOneStrategy and AllForOneStrategy. Both are configured with a mapping from exception type to supervision directive (see above) and limits on how often a child is allowed to fail before terminating it. The difference between them is that the former applies the obtained directive only to the failed child, whereas the latter applies it to all siblings as well. Normally, you should use the OneForOneStrategy, which also is the default if none is specified explicitly.\nThe AllForOneStrategy is applicable in cases where the ensemble of children has such tight dependencies among them, that a failure of one child affects the function of the others, i.e. they are inextricably linked. Since a restart does not clear out the mailbox, it often is best to terminate the children upon failure and re-create them explicitly from the supervisor (by watching the children’s lifecycle); otherwise, you have to make sure that it is no problem for any of the actors to receive a message which was queued before the restart but processed afterwards.\nNormally stopping a child (i.e. not in response to a failure) will not automatically terminate the other children in an all-for-one strategy; this can be done by watching their lifecycle: if the Terminated message is not handled by the supervisor, it will throw a DeathPactException which (depending on its supervisor) will restart it, and the default preRestart action will terminate all children. Of course, this can be handled explicitly as well.\nPlease note that creating one-off actors from an all-for-one supervisor entails that failures escalated by the temporary actor will affect all the permanent ones. If this is not desired, install an intermediate supervisor; this can very be done by declaring a router of size 1 for the worker, see Routing.","title":"One-For-One Strategy vs. All-For-One Strategy"},{"location":"/fault-tolerance.html","text":"","title":"Classic Fault Tolerance"},{"location":"/fault-tolerance.html#classic-fault-tolerance","text":"Note Pekko Classic pertains to the original Actor APIs, which have been improved by more type safe and guided Actor APIs.

First off, it is a one-for-one strategy, meaning that each child is treated separately (an all-for-one strategy works very similarly, the only difference is that any decision is applied to all children of the supervisor, not only the failing one). In the above example, 10 and 1 minuteDuration.create(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES) are passed to the maxNrOfRetries and withinTimeRange parameters respectively, which means that the strategy restarts a child up to 10 restarts per minute. The child actor is stopped if the restart count exceeds maxNrOfRetries during the withinTimeRange duration.\nAlso, there are special values for these parameters. If you specify:\n-1 to maxNrOfRetries, and Duration.InfDuration.Inf() to withinTimeRange then the child is always restarted without any limit -1 to maxNrOfRetries, and a non-infinite Duration to withinTimeRange maxNrOfRetries is treated as 1 a non-negative number to maxNrOfRetries and Duration.InfDuration.Inf() to withinTimeRange withinTimeRange is treated as infinite duration (i.e.) no matter how long it takes, once the restart count exceeds maxNrOfRetries, the child actor is stopped\nThe match statement which forms the bulk of the body is of type Decider which is a PartialFunction[Throwable, Directive]. consists of PFBuilder returned by DeciderBuilder’s match method, where the builder is finished by the build method. This is the piece which maps child failure types to their corresponding directives.\nNote If the strategy is declared inside the supervising actor (as opposed to within a companion objecta separate class) its decider has access to all internal state of the actor in a thread-safe fashion, including obtaining a reference to the currently failed child (available as the sendergetSender() of the failure message).","title":"Creating a Supervisor Strategy"},{"location":"/fault-tolerance.html#default-supervisor-strategy","text":"Escalate is used if the defined strategy doesn’t cover the exception that was thrown.\nWhen the supervisor strategy is not defined for an actor the following exceptions are handled by default:\nActorInitializationException will stop the failing child actor ActorKilledException will stop the failing child actor DeathPactException will stop the failing child actor Exception will restart the failing child actor Other types of Throwable will be escalated to parent actor\nIf the exception escalate all the way up to the root guardian it will handle it in the same way as the default strategy defined above.\nYou can combine your own strategy with the default strategy: copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.OneForOneStrategy\nimport pekko.actor.SupervisorStrategy._\nimport scala.concurrent.duration._\n\noverride val supervisorStrategy =\n  OneForOneStrategy(maxNrOfRetries = 10, withinTimeRange = 1 minute) {\n    case _: ArithmeticException => Resume\n    case t =>\n      super.supervisorStrategy.decider.applyOrElse(t, (_: Any) => Escalate)\n  }","title":"Default Supervisor Strategy"},{"location":"/fault-tolerance.html#stopping-supervisor-strategy","text":"Closer to the Erlang way is the strategy to stop children when they fail and then take corrective action in the supervisor when DeathWatch signals the loss of the child.

One of the prime examples when this is useful is when a PersistentActor fails (by stopping) with a persistence failure - which indicates that the database may be down or overloaded, in such situations it makes most sense to give it a little bit of time to recover before the persistent actor is started.\n[1] A failure can be indicated in two different ways; by an actor stopping or crashing.","title":"Delayed restarts for classic actors"},{"location":"/fault-tolerance.html#supervision-strategies","text":"There are two basic supervision strategies available for backoff:\n‘On failure’: The supervisor will terminate and then start the supervised actor if it crashes.

By adding additional randomness to the re-start intervals the actors will start in slightly different points in time, thus avoiding large spikes of traffic hitting the recovering shared database or other resource that they all need to contact.\nThe org.apache.pekko.pattern.BackoffSupervisor actor can also be configured to stop and start the actor after a delay when the actor crashes and the supervision strategy decides that it should restart.\nThe following snippet shows how to create a backoff supervisor which will start the given echo actor after it has crashed because of some exception, in increasing intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24 and finally 30 seconds:\nScala copysourceval childProps = Props(classOf[EchoActor])\n\nval supervisor = BackoffSupervisor.props(\n  BackoffOpts.onFailure(\n    childProps,\n    childName = \"myEcho\",\n    minBackoff = 3.seconds,\n    maxBackoff = 30.seconds,\n    randomFactor = 0.2 // adds 20% \"noise\" to vary the intervals slightly\n  ))\n\nsystem.actorOf(supervisor, name = \"echoSupervisor\") Java copysourcefinal Props childProps = Props.create(EchoActor.class);\n\nfinal Props supervisorProps =\n    BackoffSupervisor.props(\n        BackoffOpts.onFailure(\n            childProps,\n            \"myEcho\",\n            Duration.ofSeconds(3),\n            Duration.ofSeconds(30),\n            0.2)); // adds 20% \"noise\" to vary the intervals slightly\n\nsystem.actorOf(supervisorProps, \"echoSupervisor\");","title":"Simple backoff"},{"location":"/fault-tolerance.html#customization","text":"The org.apache.pekko.pattern.BackoffOnFailureOptions and org.apache.pekko.pattern.BackoffOnRestartOptions can be used to customize the behavior of the back-off supervisor actor.

Group - The routee actors are created externally to the router and the router sends messages to the specified path using actor selection, without watching for termination.\nThe settings for a router actor can be defined in configuration or programmatically. In order to make an actor to make use of an externally configurable router the FromConfig props wrapper must be used to denote that the actor accepts routing settings from configuration. This is in contrast with Remote Deployment where such marker props is not necessary. If the props of an actor is NOT wrapped in FromConfig it will ignore the router section of the deployment configuration.\nYou send messages to the routees via the router actor in the same way as for ordinary actors, i.e. via its ActorRefActorRef. The router actor forwards messages onto its routees without changing the original sender. When a routee replies to a routed message, the reply will be sent to the original sender, not to the router actor.\nNote In general, any message sent to a router will be sent onwards to its routees, but there are a few exceptions.

If no configuration is provided, routers default to a strategy of “always escalate”. This means that errors are passed up to the router’s supervisor for handling. The router’s supervisor will decide what to do about any errors.\nNote the router’s supervisor will treat the error as an error with the router itself. Therefore a directive to stop or restart will cause the router itself to stop or restart. The router, in turn, will cause its children to stop and restart.\nIt should be mentioned that the router’s restart behavior has been overridden so that a restart, while still re-creating the children, will still preserve the same number of actors in the pool.\nThis means that if you have not specified supervisorStrategy of the router or its parent a failure in a routee will escalate to the parent of the router, which will by default restart the router, which will restart all routees (it uses Escalate and does not stop routees during restart). The reason is to make the default behave such that adding withRouterwithRouter to a child’s definition does not change the supervision strategy applied to the child.

Therefore you cannot use it for workflows that require state to be kept within the routee, you would in this case have to include the whole state in the messages. With a SmallestMailboxPool you can have a vertically scaling service that can interact in a stateful fashion with other services in the back-end before replying to the original client. The other advantage is that it does not place a restriction on the message queue implementation as BalancingPool does.\nNote Do not use Broadcast Messages when you use BalancingPool for routers, as described in Specially Handled Messages.\nBalancingPool defined in configuration:\ncopysourcepekko.actor.deployment {\n  /parent/router9 {\n    router = balancing-pool\n    nr-of-instances = 5\n  }\n}\nScala copysourceval router9: ActorRef =\n  context.actorOf(FromConfig.props(Props[Worker]()), \"router9\") Java copysourceActorRef router9 =\n    getContext().actorOf(FromConfig.getInstance().props(Props.create(Worker.class)), \"router9\");\nBalancingPool defined in code:\nScala copysourceval router10: ActorRef =\n  context.actorOf(BalancingPool(5).props(Props[Worker]()), \"router10\") Java copysourceActorRef router10 =\n    getContext().actorOf(new BalancingPool(5).props(Props.create(Worker.class)), \"router10\");\nAddition configuration for the balancing dispatcher, which is used by the pool, can be configured in the pool-dispatcher section of the router deployment configuration.\ncopysourcepekko.actor.deployment {\n  /parent/router9b {\n    router = balancing-pool\n    nr-of-instances = 5\n    pool-dispatcher {\n      attempt-teamwork = off\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe BalancingPoolBalancingPool automatically uses a special BalancingDispatcher for its routees - disregarding any dispatcher that is set on the routee Props object. This is needed in order to implement the balancing semantics via sharing the same mailbox by all the routees.\nWhile it is not possible to change the dispatcher used by the routees, it is possible to fine tune the used executor. By default the fork-join-dispatcher is used and can be configured as explained in Dispatchers. In situations where the routees are expected to perform blocking operations it may be useful to replace it with a thread-pool-executor hinting the number of allocated threads explicitly:\ncopysourcepekko.actor.deployment {\n  /parent/router10b {\n    router = balancing-pool\n    nr-of-instances = 5\n    pool-dispatcher {\n      executor = \"thread-pool-executor\"\n\n      # allocate exactly 5 threads for this pool\n      thread-pool-executor {\n        core-pool-size-min = 5\n        core-pool-size-max = 5\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nIt is also possible to change the mailbox used by the balancing dispatcher for scenarios where the default unbounded mailbox is not well suited. An example of such a scenario could arise whether there exists the need to manage priority for each message. You can then implement a priority mailbox and configure your dispatcher:\ncopysourcepekko.actor.deployment {\n  /parent/router10c {\n    router = balancing-pool\n    nr-of-instances = 5\n    pool-dispatcher {\n      mailbox = myapp.myprioritymailbox\n    }\n  }\n}\nNote Bear in mind that BalancingDispatcher requires a message queue that must be thread-safe for multiple concurrent consumers.

When your task is IO bound, the optimal size is bound to optimal number of concurrent connections to that IO service - e.g. a 4 node elastic search cluster may handle 4-8 concurrent requests at optimal speed.\nIt achieves this by keeping track of message throughput at each pool size and performing the following three resizing operations (one at a time) periodically:\nDownsize if it hasn’t seen all routees ever fully utilized for a period of time.

Routers are designed to be extremely efficient at receiving messages and passing them quickly on to routees.\nA normal actor can be used for routing messages, but an actor’s single-threaded processing can become a bottleneck. Routers can achieve much higher throughput with an optimization to the usual message-processing pipeline that allows concurrent routing. This is achieved by embedding routers’ routing logic directly in their ActorRefActorRef rather than in the router actor. Messages sent to a router’s ActorRef can be immediately routed to the routee, bypassing the single-threaded router actor entirely.\nThe cost to this is that the internals of routing code are more complicated than if routers were implemented with normal actors. Fortunately all of this complexity is invisible to consumers of the routing API. However, it is something to be aware of when implementing your own routers.","title":"How Routing is Designed within Pekko"},{"location":"/routing.html#custom-router","text":"You can create your own router should you not find any of the ones provided by Pekko sufficient for your needs. In order to roll your own router you have to fulfill certain criteria which are explained in this section.\nBefore creating your own router you should consider whether a normal actor with router-like behavior might do the job just as well as a full-blown router. As explained above, the primary benefit of routers over normal actors is their higher performance. But they are somewhat more complicated to write than normal actors. Therefore if lower maximum throughput is acceptable in your application you may wish to stick with traditional actors. This section, however, assumes that you wish to get maximum performance and so demonstrates how you can create your own router.\nThe router created in this example is replicating each message to a few destinations.\nStart with the routing logic:\nScala copysourceimport scala.collection.immutable\nimport java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom\nimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.routing.RoundRobinRoutingLogic\nimport pekko.routing.RoutingLogic\nimport pekko.routing.Routee\nimport pekko.routing.SeveralRoutees\n\nclass RedundancyRoutingLogic(nbrCopies: Int) extends RoutingLogic {\n  val roundRobin = RoundRobinRoutingLogic()\n  def select(message: Any, routees: immutable.IndexedSeq[Routee]): Routee = {\n    val targets = (1 to nbrCopies).map(_ => roundRobin.select(message, routees))\n    SeveralRoutees(targets)\n  }\n} Java copysourcestatic class RedundancyRoutingLogic implements RoutingLogic {\n  private final int nbrCopies;\n\n  public RedundancyRoutingLogic(int nbrCopies) {\n    this.nbrCopies = nbrCopies;\n  }\n\n  RoundRobinRoutingLogic roundRobin = new RoundRobinRoutingLogic();\n\n  @Override\n  public Routee select(Object message, IndexedSeq<Routee> routees) {\n    List<Routee> targets = new ArrayList<Routee>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < nbrCopies; i++) {\n      targets.add(roundRobin.select(message, routees));\n    }\n    return new SeveralRoutees(targets);\n  }\n}\nselect will be called for each message and in this example pick a few destinations by round-robin, by reusing the existing RoundRobinRoutingLogicRoundRobinRoutingLogic and wrap the result in a SeveralRouteesSeveralRoutees instance.

Within the body of the actor a DSL is used for declaring the state machine:\nstartWith defines the initial state and initial data then there is one when(<state>) { ... } declaration per state to be handled (could potentially be multiple ones, the passed PartialFunction will be concatenated using orElse) finally starting it up using initialize, which performs the transition into the initial state and sets up timers (if required).\nIn this case, we start out in the Idle state with Uninitialized data, where only the SetTarget() message is handled; stay prepares to end this event’s processing for not leaving the current state, while the using modifier makes the FSM replace the internal state (which is Uninitialized at this point) with a fresh Todo() object containing the target actor reference. The Active state has a state timeout declared, which means that if no message is received for 1 second, a FSM.StateTimeout message will be generated. This has the same effect as receiving the Flush command in this case, namely to transition back into the Idle state and resetting the internal queue to the empty vector. But how do messages get queued? Since this shall work identically in both states, we make use of the fact that any event which is not handled by the when() block is passed to the whenUnhandled() block:\nScala copysourcewhenUnhandled {\n  // common code for both states\n  case Event(Queue(obj), t @ Todo(_, v)) =>\n    goto(Active).using(t.copy(queue = v :+ obj))\n\n  case Event(e, s) =>\n    log.warning(\"received unhandled request {} in state {}/{}\", e, stateName, s)\n    stay()\n} Java copysourcewhenUnhandled(\n    matchEvent(\n            Queue.class,\n            Todo.class,\n            (queue, todo) -> goTo(Active).using(todo.addElement(queue.getObj())))\n        .anyEvent(\n            (event, state) -> {\n              log()\n                  .warning(\n                      \"received unhandled request {} in state {}/{}\",\n                      event,\n                      stateName(),\n                      state);\n              return stay();\n            }));\nThe first case handled here is adding Queue() requests to the internal queue and going to the Active state (this does the obvious thing of staying in the Active state if already there), but only if the FSM data are not Uninitialized when the Queue() event is received. Otherwise—and in all other non-handled cases—the second case just logs a warning and does not change the internal state.\nThe only missing piece is where the Batches are actually sent to the target, for which we use the onTransition mechanism: you can declare multiple such blocks and all of them will be tried for matching behavior in case a state transition occurs (i.e. only when the state actually changes).\nScala copysourceonTransition {\n  case Active -> Idle =>\n    stateData match {\n      case Todo(ref, queue) => ref ! Batch(queue)\n      case _                => // nothing to do\n    }\n} Java copysourceonTransition(\n    matchState(\n            Active,\n            Idle,\n            () -> {\n              // reuse this matcher\n              final UnitMatch<Data> m =\n                  UnitMatch.create(\n                      matchData(\n                          Todo.class,\n                          todo ->\n                              todo.getTarget().tell(new Batch(todo.getQueue()), getSelf())));\n              m.match(stateData());\n            })\n        .state(\n            Idle,\n            Active,\n            () -> {\n              /* Do something here */\n            }));\nThe transition callback is a partial functionbuilder constructed by matchState, followed by zero or multiple state, which takes as input a pair of states—the current and the next state. The FSM trait includes a convenience extractor for these in form of an arrow operator, which conveniently reminds you of the direction of the state change which is being matched. During the state change, the old state data is available via stateDatastateData() as shown, and the new state data would be available as nextStateDatanextStateData().\nNote Same-state transitions can be implemented (when currently in state S) using goto(S) or stay(). The difference between those being that goto(S) will emit an event S->S event that can be handled by onTransition, whereas stay() will not.\nTo verify that this buncher actually works, it is quite easy to write a test using the Testing Actor Systems which is conveniently bundled with ScalaTest traits into PekkoSpecTestKit, here using JUnit as an example:\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.Props\nimport scala.collection.immutable\n\nobject FSMDocSpec {\n  // messages and data types\n}\n\nclass FSMDocSpec extends MyFavoriteTestFrameWorkPlusPekkoTestKit {\n  import FSMDocSpec._\n\n  import pekko.actor.{ ActorRef, FSM }\n  import scala.concurrent.duration._\n  class Buncher extends FSM[State, Data] {\n\n    startWith(Idle, Uninitialized)\n\n    when(Idle) {\n      case Event(SetTarget(ref), Uninitialized) =>\n        stay().using(Todo(ref, Vector.empty))\n    }\n\n    onTransition {\n      case Active -> Idle =>\n        stateData match {\n          case Todo(ref, queue) => ref !

The dual view is to describe it as a series of transitions. This is enabled by the method\nonTransition(handler)\nwhich associates actions with a transition instead of with a state and event.

This is designed specifically so you can put all transition handling for a certain aspect into one place without having to worry about earlier declarations shadowing later ones; the actions are still executed in declaration order, though.\nNote This kind of internal monitoring may be used to structure your FSM according to transitions, so that for example the cancellation of a timer upon leaving a certain state cannot be forgot when adding new target states.","title":"Internal Monitoring"},{"location":"/fsm.html#external-monitoring","text":"External actors may be registered to be notified of state transitions by sending a message SubscribeTransitionCallBack(actorRef).

The state of the ExamplePersistentActor is a list of persisted event data contained in ExampleState.\nThe persistent actor’s receiveRecovercreateReceiveRecover method defines how state is updated during recovery by handling Evt and SnapshotOffer messages. The persistent actor’s receiveCommandcreateReceive method is a command handler. In this example, a command is handled by generating an event which is then persisted and handled. Events are persisted by calling persist with an event (or a sequence of events) as first argument and an event handler as second argument.\nThe persist method persists events asynchronously and the event handler is executed for successfully persisted events. Successfully persisted events are internally sent back to the persistent actor as individual messages that trigger event handler executions. An event handler may close over persistent actor state and mutate it. The sender of a persisted event is the sender of the corresponding command. This allows event handlers to reply to the sender of a command (not shown).\nThe main responsibility of an event handler is changing persistent actor state using event data and notifying others about successful state changes by publishing events.\nWhen persisting events with persist it is guaranteed that the persistent actor will not receive further commands between the persist call and the execution(s) of the associated event handler. This also holds for multiple persist calls in context of a single command. Incoming messages are stashed until the persist is completed.\nIf persistence of an event fails, onPersistFailure will be invoked (logging the error by default), and the actor will unconditionally be stopped. If persistence of an event is rejected before it is stored, e.g. due to serialization error, onPersistRejected will be invoked (logging a warning by default) and the actor continues with the next message.\nNote It’s also possible to switch between different command handlers during normal processing and recovery with context.become()getContext().become() and context.unbecome()getContext().unbecome(). To get the actor into the same state after recovery you need to take special care to perform the same state transitions with become and unbecome in the receiveRecovercreateReceiveRecover method as you would have done in the command handler.

Since the incoming commands will be drained from the Actor’s mailbox and put into its internal stash while awaiting the confirmation (thus, before calling the persist handlers) the Actor may receive and (auto)handle the PoisonPill before it processes the other messages which have been put into its stash, causing a pre-mature shutdown of the Actor.\nWarning Consider using explicit shut-down messages instead of PoisonPill when working with persistent actors.\nThe example below highlights how messages arrive in the Actor’s mailbox and how they interact with its internal stashing mechanism when persist() is used.

Because some use cases may not benefit from or need snapshots, it is perfectly valid not to not configure a snapshot store. However, Pekko will log a warning message when this situation is detected and then continue to operate until an actor tries to store a snapshot, at which point the operation will fail (by replying with an SaveSnapshotFailureSaveSnapshotFailure for example).

The AtLeastOnceDelivery traitAbstractPersistentActorWithAtLeastOnceDelivery class does not persist anything by itself.

Once recovery has completed, if there are outstanding messages that have not been confirmed (during the message replay), the persistent actor will resend these before sending any other messages.\nDeliver requires a deliveryIdToMessage function to pass the provided deliveryId into the message so that the correlation between deliver and confirmDelivery is possible.

The same sequence is used for all destinations of the actor, i.e. when sending to multiple destinations the destinations will see gaps in the sequence. It is not possible to use custom deliveryId. However, you can send a custom correlation identifier in the message to the destination. You must then retain a mapping between the internal deliveryId (passed into the deliveryIdToMessage function) and your custom correlation id (passed into the message). You can do this by storing such mapping in a Map(correlationId -> deliveryId) from which you can retrieve the deliveryId to be passed into the confirmDelivery method once the receiver of your message has replied with your custom correlation id.\nThe AtLeastOnceDelivery traitAbstractPersistentActorWithAtLeastOnceDelivery class has a state consisting of unconfirmed messages and a sequence number. It does not store this state itself. You must persist events corresponding to the deliverdeliver and confirmDeliveryconfirmDelivery invocations from your PersistentActor so that the state can be restored by calling the same methods during the recovery phase of the PersistentActor. Sometimes these events can be derived from other business level events, and sometimes you must create separate events. During recovery, calls to deliver will not send out messages, those will be sent later if no matching confirmDelivery will have been performed.\nSupport for snapshots is provided by getDeliverySnapshotgetDeliverySnapshot and setDeliverySnapshotsetDeliverySnapshot. The AtLeastOnceDelivery.AtLeastOnceDeliverySnapshotAtLeastOnceDelivery.AtLeastOnceDeliverySnapshot contains the full delivery state, including unconfirmed messages. If you need a custom snapshot for other parts of the actor state you must also include the AtLeastOnceDeliverySnapshot. It is serialized using protobuf with the ordinary Pekko serialization mechanism. It is easiest to include the bytes of the AtLeastOnceDeliverySnapshot as a blob in your custom snapshot.\nThe interval between redelivery attempts is defined by the redeliverIntervalredeliverInterval method. The default value can be configured with the pekko.persistence.at-least-once-delivery.redeliver-interval configuration key. The method can be overridden by implementation classes to return non-default values.\nThe maximum number of messages that will be sent at each redelivery burst is defined by the redeliverBurstLimitredeliverBurstLimit method (burst frequency is half of the redelivery interval). If there’s a lot of unconfirmed messages (e.g. if the destination is not available for a long time), this helps to prevent an overwhelming amount of messages to be sent at once. The default value can be configured with the pekko.persistence.at-least-once-delivery.redelivery-burst-limit configuration key. The method can be overridden by implementation classes to return non-default values.\nAfter a number of delivery attempts a AtLeastOnceDelivery.UnconfirmedWarningAtLeastOnceDelivery.UnconfirmedWarning message will be sent to self. The re-sending will still continue, but you can choose to call confirmDelivery to cancel the re-sending. The number of delivery attempts before emitting the warning is defined by the warnAfterNumberOfUnconfirmedAttemptswarnAfterNumberOfUnconfirmedAttempts method. The default value can be configured with the pekko.persistence.at-least-once-delivery.warn-after-number-of-unconfirmed-attempts configuration key. The method can be overridden by implementation classes to return non-default values.\nThe AtLeastOnceDelivery traitAbstractPersistentActorWithAtLeastOnceDelivery class holds messages in memory until their successful delivery has been confirmed.

If this limit is exceed the deliver method will not accept more messages and it will throw AtLeastOnceDelivery.MaxUnconfirmedMessagesExceededExceptionAtLeastOnceDelivery.MaxUnconfirmedMessagesExceededException. The default value can be configured with the pekko.persistence.at-least-once-delivery.max-unconfirmed-messages configuration key.

For these scenarios the toJournaltoJournal function is usually an identity function, however the fromJournalfromJournal is implemented as v1.Event=>v2.Event, performing the necessary mapping inside the fromJournal method. This technique is sometimes referred to as “upcasting” in other CQRS libraries. Separating Domain and Data models – thanks to EventAdapters it is possible to completely separate the domain model from the model used to persist data in the Journals. For example one may want to use case classes in the domain model, however persist their protocol-buffer (or any other binary serialization format) counter-parts to the Journal. A simple toJournal:MyModel=>MyDataModel and fromJournal:MyDataModel=>MyModel adapter can be used to implement this feature. Journal Specialized Data Types – exposing data types understood by the underlying Journal, for example for data stores which understand JSON it is possible to write an EventAdapter toJournal:Any=>JSON such that the Journal can directly store the json instead of serializing the object to its binary representation.\nImplementing an EventAdapter is rather straightforward:\nScala copysourceclass MyEventAdapter(system: ExtendedActorSystem) extends EventAdapter {\n  override def manifest(event: Any): String =\n    \"\" // when no manifest needed, return \"\"\n\n  override def toJournal(event: Any): Any =\n    event // identity\n\n  override def fromJournal(event: Any, manifest: String): EventSeq =\n    EventSeq.single(event) // identity\n} Java copysourceclass MyEventAdapter implements EventAdapter {\n  @Override\n  public String manifest(Object event) {\n    return \"\"; // if no manifest needed, return \"\"\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Object toJournal(Object event) {\n    return event; // identity\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public EventSeq fromJournal(Object event, String manifest) {\n    return EventSeq.single(event); // identity\n  }\n}\nThen in order for it to be used on events coming to and from the journal you must bind it using the below configuration syntax:\ncopysourcepekko.persistence.journal {\n  inmem {\n    event-adapters {\n      tagging        = \"docs.persistence.MyTaggingEventAdapter\"\n      user-upcasting = \"docs.persistence.UserUpcastingEventAdapter\"\n      item-upcasting = \"docs.persistence.ItemUpcastingEventAdapter\"\n    }\n\n    event-adapter-bindings {\n      \"docs.persistence.Item\"        = tagging\n      \"docs.persistence.TaggedEvent\" = tagging\n      \"docs.persistence.v1.Event\"    = [user-upcasting, item-upcasting]\n    }\n  }\n}\nIt is possible to bind multiple adapters to one class for recovery, in which case the fromJournal methods of all bound adapters will be applied to a given matching event (in order of definition in the configuration). Since each adapter may return from 0 to n adapted events (called as EventSeq), each adapter can investigate the event and if it should indeed adapt it return the adapted event(s) for it. Other adapters which do not have anything to contribute during this adaptation simply return EventSeq.emptyEventSeq.empty.

If the timer is the same for all events then it can be hard coded, otherwise the old PersistentFSM timeout can be taken from the StateChangeEvent in the event adapter and is also available when constructing a SnapshotAdapter. This can be added to an internal event and then stored in the State. Care must also be taken to restart timers on recovery in the signal handler:\nScala copysource.receiveSignal {\n  case (state, RecoveryCompleted) =>\n    state match {\n      case _: Shopping | _: Inactive =>\n        timers.startSingleTimer(StateTimeout, Timeout, 1.second)\n      case _ =>\n    }\n} Java copysource@Override\npublic SignalHandler<State> signalHandler() {\n  return newSignalHandlerBuilder()\n      .onSignal(\n          RecoveryCompleted.class,\n          (state, signal) -> {\n            if (state instanceof Shopping || state instanceof Inactive) {\n              timers.startSingleTimer(TIMEOUT_KEY, Timeout.INSTANCE, Duration.ofSeconds(1));\n            }\n          })\n      .build();\n}\nThen the event handler:\nScala copysourcedef eventHandler(state: State, event: DomainEvent): State = {\n  state match {\n    case la @ LookingAround(cart) =>\n      event match {\n        case ItemAdded(item) => Shopping(cart.addItem(item))\n        case _               => la\n      }\n    case Shopping(cart) =>\n      event match {\n        case ItemAdded(item)  => Shopping(cart.addItem(item))\n        case OrderExecuted    => Paid(cart)\n        case OrderDiscarded   => state // will be stopped\n        case CustomerInactive => Inactive(cart)\n      }\n    case i @ Inactive(cart) =>\n      event match {\n        case ItemAdded(item) => Shopping(cart.addItem(item))\n        case OrderDiscarded  => i // will be stopped\n        case _               => i\n      }\n    case Paid(_) => state // no events after paid\n  }\n} Java copysource@Override\npublic EventHandler<State, DomainEvent> eventHandler() {\n  EventHandlerBuilder<State, DomainEvent> eventHandlerBuilder = newEventHandlerBuilder();\n\n  eventHandlerBuilder\n      .forStateType(LookingAround.class)\n      .onEvent(ItemAdded.class, item -> new Shopping(new ShoppingCart(item.getItem())));\n\n  eventHandlerBuilder\n      .forStateType(Shopping.class)\n      .onEvent(\n          ItemAdded.class, (state, item) -> new Shopping(state.cart.addItem(item.getItem())))\n      .onEvent(OrderExecuted.class, (state, item) -> new Paid(state.cart))\n      .onEvent(OrderDiscarded.class, (state, item) -> state) // will be stopped\n      .onEvent(CustomerInactive.class, (state, event) -> new Inactive(state.cart));\n\n  eventHandlerBuilder\n      .forStateType(Inactive.class)\n      .onEvent(\n          ItemAdded.class, (state, item) -> new Shopping(state.cart.addItem(item.getItem())))\n      .onEvent(OrderDiscarded.class, (state, item) -> state); // will be stopped\n\n  return eventHandlerBuilder.build();\n}\nThe last step is the adapters that will allow the new EventSourcedBehaviorEventSourcedBehavior to read the old data:\nScala copysourceclass PersistentFsmEventAdapter extends EventAdapter[DomainEvent, Any] {\n  override def toJournal(e: DomainEvent): Any = e\n  override def manifest(event: DomainEvent): String = \"\"\n  override def fromJournal(journalEvent: Any, manifest: String): EventSeq[DomainEvent] = {\n    journalEvent match {\n      case _: StateChangeEvent =>\n        // In this example the state transitions can be inferred from the events\n        // Alternatively the StateChangeEvent can be converted to a private event if either the StateChangeEvent.stateIdentifier\n        // or StateChangeEvent.timeout is required\n        // Many use cases have the same timeout so it can be hard coded, otherwise it cane be stored in the state\n        EventSeq.empty\n      case other =>\n        // If using a new domain event model the conversion would happen here\n        EventSeq.single(other.asInstanceOf[DomainEvent])\n    }\n\n  }\n} Java copysourcepublic static class PersistentFSMEventAdapter extends EventAdapter<DomainEvent, Object> {\n\n  @Override\n  public Object toJournal(DomainEvent domainEvent) {\n    // leave events as is, can't roll back to PersistentFSM\n    return domainEvent;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String manifest(DomainEvent event) {\n    return \"\";\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public EventSeq<DomainEvent> fromJournal(Object event, String manifest) {\n    if (event instanceof org.apache.pekko.persistence.fsm.PersistentFSM.StateChangeEvent) {\n      // In this example the state transitions can be inferred from the events\n      // Alternatively the StateChangeEvent can be converted to a private event if either the\n      // StateChangeEvent.stateIdentifier\n      // or StateChangeEvent.timeout is required\n      // Many use cases have the same timeout so it can be hard coded, otherwise it cane be stored\n      // in the state\n      return EventSeq.empty();\n    } else {\n      // If using a new domain event model the conversion would happen here\n      return EventSeq.single((DomainEvent) event);\n    }\n  }\nThe snapshot adapter needs to adapt an internal type of PersistentFSM so a helper function is provided to build the SnapshotAdapterSnapshotAdapter:\nScala copysourceval persistentFSMSnapshotAdapter: SnapshotAdapter[State] = PersistentFSMMigration.snapshotAdapter[State] {\n  case (stateIdentifier, data, _) =>\n    val cart = data.asInstanceOf[ShoppingCart]\n    stateIdentifier match {\n      case \"Looking Around\" => LookingAround(cart)\n      case \"Shopping\"       => Shopping(cart)\n      case \"Inactive\"       => Inactive(cart)\n      case \"Paid\"           => Paid(cart)\n      case id               => throw new IllegalStateException(s\"Unexpected state identifier $id\")\n    }\n} Java copysource@Override\npublic SnapshotAdapter<State> snapshotAdapter() {\n  return PersistentFSMMigration.snapshotAdapter(\n      (stateIdentifier, snapshot, timeout) -> {\n        ShoppingCart cart = (ShoppingCart) snapshot;\n        switch (stateIdentifier) {\n          case \"Looking Around\":\n            return new LookingAround(cart);\n          case \"Shopping\":\n            return new Shopping(cart);\n          case \"Inactive\":\n            return new Inactive(cart);\n          case \"Paid\":\n            return new Paid(cart);\n          default:\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unexpected state identifier \" + stateIdentifier);\n        }\n      });\n}\nThat concludes all the steps to allow an EventSourcedBehaviorEventSourcedBehavior to read a PersistentFSM’s data. Once the new code has been running you can not roll back as the PersistentFSM will not be able to read data written by Persistence Typed.\nNote There is one case where a full shutdown and startup is required.","title":"Migration steps"},{"location":"/testing.html","text":"","title":"Testing Classic Actors"},{"location":"/testing.html#testing-classic-actors","text":"Note Pekko Classic pertains to the original Actor APIs, which have been improved by more type safe and guided Actor APIs.

The definition of the environment depends very much on the problem at hand and the level at which you intend to test, ranging from simple checks to full system tests.\nThe minimal setup consists of the test procedure, which provides the desired stimuli, the actor under test, and an actor receiving replies. Bigger systems replace the actor under test with a network of actors, apply stimuli at varying injection points and arrange results to be sent from different emission points, but the basic principle stays the same in that a single procedure drives the test.\nThe TestKit class contains a collection of tools which makes this common task easy.\nScala copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.ActorSystem\nimport pekko.testkit.{ ImplicitSender, TestActors, TestKit }\nimport org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll\nimport org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers\nimport org.scalatest.wordspec.AnyWordSpecLike\n\nclass MySpec()\n    extends TestKit(ActorSystem(\"MySpec\"))\n    with ImplicitSender\n    with AnyWordSpecLike\n    with Matchers\n    with BeforeAndAfterAll {\n\n  override def afterAll(): Unit = {\n    TestKit.shutdownActorSystem(system)\n  }\n\n  \"An Echo actor\" must {\n\n    \"send back messages unchanged\" in {\n      val echo = system.actorOf(TestActors.echoActorProps)\n      echo ! \"hello world\"\n      expectMsg(\"hello world\")\n    }\n\n  }\n} Java copysourceimport jdocs.AbstractJavaTest;\nimport org.apache.pekko.testkit.javadsl.TestKit;\nimport org.junit.AfterClass;\nimport org.junit.Assert;\nimport org.junit.BeforeClass;\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.ActorRef;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.ActorSystem;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.Props;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.AbstractActor;\n\nimport java.time.Duration;\n\npublic class TestKitSampleTest extends AbstractJavaTest {\n\n  public static class SomeActor extends AbstractActor {\n    ActorRef target = null;\n\n    @Override\n    public Receive createReceive() {\n      return receiveBuilder()\n          .matchEquals(\n              \"hello\",\n              message -> {\n                getSender().tell(\"world\", getSelf());\n                if (target != null) target.forward(message, getContext());\n              })\n          .match(\n              ActorRef.class,\n              actorRef -> {\n                target = actorRef;\n                getSender().tell(\"done\", getSelf());\n              })\n          .build();\n    }\n  }\n\n  static ActorSystem system;\n\n  @BeforeClass\n  public static void setup() {\n    system = ActorSystem.create();\n  }\n\n  @AfterClass\n  public static void teardown() {\n    TestKit.shutdownActorSystem(system);\n    system = null;\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testIt() {\n    /*\n     * Wrap the whole test procedure within a testkit constructor\n     * if you want to receive actor replies or use Within(), etc.\n     */\n    new TestKit(system) {\n      {\n        final Props props = Props.create(SomeActor.class);\n        final ActorRef subject = system.actorOf(props);\n\n        // can also use JavaTestKit “from the outside”\n        final TestKit probe = new TestKit(system);\n        // “inject” the probe by passing it to the test subject\n        // like a real resource would be passed in production\n        subject.tell(probe.getRef(), getRef());\n        // await the correct response\n        expectMsg(Duration.ofSeconds(1), \"done\");\n\n        // the run() method needs to finish within 3 seconds\n        within(\n            Duration.ofSeconds(3),\n            () -> {\n              subject.tell(\"hello\", getRef());\n\n              // This is a demo: would normally use expectMsgEquals().\n              // Wait time is bounded by 3-second deadline above.\n              awaitCond(probe::msgAvailable);\n\n              // response must have been enqueued to us before probe\n              expectMsg(Duration.ZERO, \"world\");\n              // check that the probe we injected earlier got the msg\n              probe.expectMsg(Duration.ZERO, \"hello\");\n              Assert.assertEquals(getRef(), probe.getLastSender());\n\n              // Will wait for the rest of the 3 seconds\n              expectNoMessage();\n              return null;\n            });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\nThe TestKit contains an actor named testActor which is the entry point for messages to be examined with the various expectMsg... assertions detailed below.

The test actor’s reference is obtained using the getRef() method as demonstrated above. The testActor may also be passed to other actors, as usual, usually subscribing it as notification listener. There is a whole set of examination methods, e.g. receiving all consecutive messages matching certain criteria, receiving a whole sequence of fixed messages or classes, receiving nothing for some time, etc.\nThe ActorSystem passed to the constructor of TestKit is accessible via the system membergetSystem() method.\nNote Remember to shut down the actor system after the test is finished (also in case of failure) so that all actors—including the test actor—are stopped.","title":"Asynchronous Testing: TestKit"},{"location":"/testing.html#built-in-assertions","text":"The above-mentioned expectMsgexpectMsgEquals is not the only method for formulating assertions concerning received messages, the full set is this:\nScala copysourceval hello: String = expectMsg(\"hello\")\nval any: String = expectMsgAnyOf(\"hello\", \"world\")\nval all: immutable.Seq[String] = expectMsgAllOf(\"hello\", \"world\")\nval i: Int = expectMsgType[Int]\nexpectNoMessage(200.millis)\nval two: immutable.Seq[AnyRef] = receiveN(2) Java copysourcefinal String hello = expectMsgEquals(\"hello\");\nfinal String any = expectMsgAnyOf(\"hello\", \"world\");\nfinal List<String> all = expectMsgAllOf(\"hello\", \"world\");\nfinal int i = expectMsgClass(Integer.class);\nfinal Number j = expectMsgAnyClassOf(Integer.class, Long.class);\nexpectNoMessage();\nfinal List<Object> two = receiveN(2);\nIn these examples, the maximum durations you will find mentioned below are left out, in which case they use the default value from the configuration item pekko.test.single-expect-default which itself defaults to 3 seconds (or they obey the innermost enclosing Within as detailed below).

The maximum duration defaults to the time remaining in the innermost enclosing within block and the idle duration defaults to infinity (thereby disabling the idle-timeout feature).

Another approach is to use it for the creation of simple probe actors to be inserted in the message flows. To make this more powerful and convenient, there is a concrete implementation called TestProbe. The functionality is best explained using a small example:\nScala copysourceimport scala.concurrent.duration._\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor._\nimport org.apache.pekko.testkit.TestProbe\n copysourceclass MyDoubleEcho extends Actor {\n  var dest1: ActorRef = _\n  var dest2: ActorRef = _\n  def receive = {\n    case (d1: ActorRef, d2: ActorRef) =>\n      dest1 = d1\n      dest2 = d2\n    case x =>\n      dest1 ! x\n      dest2 ! x\n  }\n}\n copysourceval probe1 = TestProbe()\nval probe2 = TestProbe()\nval actor = system.actorOf(Props[MyDoubleEcho]())\nactor !

Attaching two test probes enables verification of the (simplistic) behaviorThis simple test verifies an equally simple Forwarder actor by injecting a probe as the forwarder’s target. Another example would be two actors A and B which collaborate by A sending messages to B. To verify this message flow, a TestProbe could be inserted as a target of A, using the forwarding capabilities or auto-pilot described below to include a real B in the test setup.\nIf you have many test probes, you can name them to get meaningful actor names in test logs and assertions:\nScala copysourceval worker = TestProbe(\"worker\")\nval aggregator = TestProbe(\"aggregator\")\n\nworker.ref.path.name should startWith(\"worker\")\naggregator.ref.path.name should startWith(\"aggregator\") Java copysourcenew TestKit(system) {\n  {\n    final TestProbe worker = new TestProbe(system, \"worker\");\n    final TestProbe aggregator = new TestProbe(system, \"aggregator\");\n\n    assertTrue(worker.ref().path().name().startsWith(\"worker\"));\n    assertTrue(aggregator.ref().path().name().startsWith(\"aggregator\"));\n  }\n};\nProbes may also be equipped with custom assertions to make your test code even more concise and clear:\nScala copysourcefinal case class Update(id: Int, value: String)\n\nval probe = new TestProbe(system) {\n  def expectUpdate(x: Int) = {\n    expectMsgPF() {\n      case Update(id, _) if id == x => ()\n    }\n    sender() ! \"ACK\"\n  }\n} Java copysourcenew TestKit(system) {\n  {\n    class MyProbe extends TestKit {\n      public MyProbe() {\n        super(system);\n      }\n\n      public void assertHello() {\n        expectMsgEquals(\"hello\");\n      }\n    }\n\n    final MyProbe probe = new MyProbe();\n    probe.getRef().tell(\"hello\", ActorRef.noSender());\n    probe.assertHello();\n  }\n};\nYou have complete flexibility here in mixing and matching the TestKit facilities with your checks and choosing an intuitive name for it.

The simplest example of this situation is an actor which sends a message to itself. In this case, processing cannot continue immediately as that would violate the actor model, so the invocation is queued and will be processed when the active invocation on that actor finishes its processing; thus, it will be processed on the calling thread, but after the actor finishes its previous work. In the other case, the invocation is processed immediately on the current thread. Futures scheduled via this dispatcher are also executed immediately.\nThis scheme makes the CallingThreadDispatcher work like a general purpose dispatcher for any actors which never block on external events.\nIn the presence of multiple threads, it may happen that two invocations of an actor running on this dispatcher happen on two different threads at the same time. In this case, both will be processed directly on their respective threads, where both compete for the actor’s lock and the loser has to wait. Thus, the actor model is left intact, but the price is the loss of concurrency due to limited scheduling. In a sense, this is equivalent to traditional mutex style concurrency.\nThe other remaining difficulty is correct handling of suspend and resume: when an actor is suspended, subsequent invocations will be queued in thread-local queues (the same ones used for queuing in the normal case). The call to resume, however, is done by one specific thread, and all other threads in the system will probably not be executing this specific actor, which leads to the problem that the thread-local queues cannot be emptied by their native threads. Hence, the thread calling resume will collect all currently queued invocations from all threads into its queue and process them.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"/testing.html#limitations","text":"Warning In case the CallingThreadDispatcher is used for top-level actors, without going through TestActorRef, then there is a time window during which the actor is awaiting construction by the user guardian actor. Sending messages to the actor during this time will result in them being enqueued and then executed on the guardian’s thread instead of the caller’s thread. To avoid this, use TestActorRef.\nIf an actor’s behavior blocks on something which would normally be affected by the calling actor after having sent the message, this will dead-lock when using this dispatcher. This is a common scenario in actor tests based on CountDownLatch for synchronization:\nval latch = new CountDownLatch(1)\nactor ! startWorkAfter(latch)   // actor will call latch.await() before proceeding\ndoSomeSetupStuff()\nlatch.countDown()\nThe example would hang indefinitely within the message processing initiated on the second line and never reach the fourth line, which would unblock it on a normal dispatcher.\nThus, keep in mind that the CallingThreadDispatcher is not a general-purpose replacement for the normal dispatchers. If you are looking for a tool to help you debug dead-locks, the CallingThreadDispatcher may help with some error scenarios, but keep in mind that it may give false negatives as well as false positives.","title":"Limitations"},{"location":"/testing.html#thread-interruptions","text":"If the CallingThreadDispatcher sees that the current thread has its isInterrupted() flag set when message processing returns, it will throw an InterruptedException after finishing all its processing (i.e. all messages which need processing as described above are processed before this happens). As tell cannot throw exceptions due to its contract, this exception will then be caught and logged, and the thread’s interrupted status will be set again.\nIf during message processing an InterruptedException is thrown then it will be caught inside the CallingThreadDispatcher’s message handling loop, the thread’s interrupted flag will be set and processing continues normally.\nNote In summary, if the current thread is interrupted while doing work under the CallingThreadDispatcher, then that will result in the isInterrupted flag to be true when the message send returns and no InterruptedException will be thrown.","title":"Thread Interruptions"},{"location":"/testing.html#benefits","text":"To summarize, these are the features that CallingThreadDispatcher has to offer:\nDeterministic execution of single-threaded tests while retaining nearly full actor semantics Full message processing history leading up to the point of failure in exception stack traces Exclusion of certain classes of dead-lock scenarios","title":"Benefits"},{"location":"/testing.html#tracing-actor-invocations","text":"The testing facilities described up to this point were aiming at formulating assertions about a system’s behavior. If a test fails, it is usually your job to find the cause, fix it and verify the test again. This process is supported by debuggers as well as logging, where the Pekko toolkit offers the following options:\nLogging of exceptions thrown within Actor instances It is always on; in contrast to the other logging mechanisms, this logs at ERROR level.\nLogging of message invocations on certain actors This is enabled by a setting in the Configuration — namely pekko.actor.debug.receive — which enables the loggable statement to be applied to an actor’s receive function: copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.event.LoggingReceive\ndef receive = LoggingReceive {\n  case msg => // Do something ...\n}\ndef otherState: Receive = LoggingReceive.withLabel(\"other\") {\n  case msg => // Do something else ...\n} If the aforementioned setting is not given in the Configuration, this method will pass through the given Receive function unmodified, meaning that there is no runtime cost unless enabled. The logging feature is coupled to this specific local mark-up because enabling it uniformly on all actors is not usually what you need, and it would lead to endless loops if it were applied to event bus logger listeners.\nLogging of special messages Actors handle certain special messages automatically, e.g. Kill, PoisonPill, etc. Tracing of these message invocations is enabled by the setting pekko.actor.debug.autoreceive, which enables this on all actors. Logging of the actor lifecycle Actor creation, start, restart, monitor start, monitor stop and stop may be traced by enabling the setting pekko.actor.debug.lifecycle; this, too, is enabled uniformly on all actors.\nLogging of these messages is at DEBUG level. To summarize, you can enable full logging of actor activities using this configuration fragment:\npekko {\n  loglevel = \"DEBUG\"\n  actor {\n    debug {\n      receive = on\n      autoreceive = on\n      lifecycle = on\n    }\n  }\n}\nDifferent Testing Frameworks Pekko’s test suite is written using ScalaTest, which also shines through in documentation examples. However, the TestKit and its facilities do not depend on that framework, so you can essentially use whichever suits your development style best. This section contains a collection of known gotchas with some other frameworks, which is by no means exhaustive and does not imply an endorsement or special support. When you need it to be a trait If for some reason it is a problem to inherit from TestKit due to it being a concrete class instead of a trait, there’s TestKitBase: copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.testkit.TestKitBase\n\nclass MyTest extends TestKitBase {\n  implicit lazy val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem()\n\n  val probe = TestProbe()\n  probe.send(testActor, \"hello\")\n  try expectMsg(\"hello\")\n  catch { case NonFatal(e) => system.terminate(); throw e }\n\n  shutdown(system)\n} The implicit lazy val system must be declared exactly like that (you can of course pass arguments to the actor system factory as needed) because trait TestKitBase needs the system during its construction. Warning: use of the trait is discouraged because of potential issues with binary backwards compatibility in the future, use at own risk. Specs2 Some Specs2 users have contributed examples of how to work around some clashes which may arise: Mixing TestKit into org.specs2.mutable.Specification results in a name clash involving the end method (which is a private variable in TestKit and an abstract method in Specification); if mixing in TestKit first, the code may compile but might then fail at runtime. The workaround—which is beneficial also for the third point—is to apply the TestKit together with org.specs2.specification.Scope. The Specification traits provide a Duration DSL which uses partly the same method names as scala.concurrent.duration.Duration, resulting in ambiguous implicits if scala.concurrent.duration._ is imported. There are two workarounds: either use the Specification variant of Duration and supply an implicit conversion to the Pekko Duration. This conversion is not supplied with the Pekko distribution because that would mean that our JAR files would depend on Specs2, which is not justified by this little feature. or mix org.specs2.time.NoTimeConversions into the Specification. Specifications are by default executed concurrently, which requires some care when writing the tests or the sequential keyword.","title":"Tracing Actor Invocations"},{"location":"/testing.html#configuration","text":"There are several configuration properties for the TestKit module, please refer to the reference configuration.\nExample Ray Roestenburg’s example code from his blog, which unfortunately is only available on web archive, adapted to work with Pekko 2.x. copysourceimport scala.util.Random\n\nimport org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll\nimport org.scalatest.wordspec.AnyWordSpecLike\nimport org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers\n\nimport com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory\n\nimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.actor.Actor\nimport pekko.actor.ActorRef\nimport pekko.actor.ActorSystem\nimport pekko.actor.Props\nimport pekko.testkit.{ DefaultTimeout, ImplicitSender, TestActors, TestKit }\nimport scala.concurrent.duration._\nimport scala.collection.immutable\n\n/**\n * a Test to show some TestKit examples\n */\nclass TestKitUsageSpec\n    extends TestKit(ActorSystem(\"TestKitUsageSpec\", ConfigFactory.parseString(TestKitUsageSpec.config)))\n    with DefaultTimeout\n    with ImplicitSender\n    with AnyWordSpecLike\n    with Matchers\n    with BeforeAndAfterAll {\n  import TestKitUsageSpec._\n\n  val echoRef = system.actorOf(TestActors.echoActorProps)\n  val forwardRef = system.actorOf(Props(classOf[ForwardingActor], testActor))\n  val filterRef = system.actorOf(Props(classOf[FilteringActor], testActor))\n  val randomHead = Random.nextInt(6)\n  val randomTail = Random.nextInt(10)\n  val headList = immutable.Seq().padTo(randomHead, \"0\")\n  val tailList = immutable.Seq().padTo(randomTail, \"1\")\n  val seqRef =\n    system.actorOf(Props(classOf[SequencingActor], testActor, headList, tailList))\n\n  override def afterAll(): Unit = {\n    shutdown()\n  }\n\n  \"An EchoActor\" should {\n    \"Respond with the same message it receives\" in {\n      within(500 millis) {\n        echoRef ! \"test\"\n        expectMsg(\"test\")\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \"A ForwardingActor\" should {\n    \"Forward a message it receives\" in {\n      within(500 millis) {\n        forwardRef ! \"test\"\n        expectMsg(\"test\")\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \"A FilteringActor\" should {\n    \"Filter all messages, except expected messagetypes it receives\" in {\n      var messages = Seq[String]()\n      within(500 millis) {\n        filterRef ! \"test\"\n        expectMsg(\"test\")\n        filterRef ! 1\n        expectNoMessage()\n        filterRef ! \"some\"\n        filterRef ! \"more\"\n        filterRef ! 1\n        filterRef ! \"text\"\n        filterRef ! 1\n\n        receiveWhile(500 millis) {\n          case msg: String => messages = msg +: messages\n        }\n      }\n      messages.length should be(3)\n      messages.reverse should be(Seq(\"some\", \"more\", \"text\"))\n    }\n  }\n  \"A SequencingActor\" should {\n    \"receive an interesting message at some point \" in {\n      within(500 millis) {\n        ignoreMsg {\n          case msg: String => msg != \"something\"\n        }\n        seqRef ! \"something\"\n        expectMsg(\"something\")\n        ignoreMsg {\n          case msg: String => msg == \"1\"\n        }\n        expectNoMessage()\n        ignoreNoMsg()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nobject TestKitUsageSpec {\n  // Define your test specific configuration here\n  val config = \"\"\"\n    pekko {\n      loglevel = \"WARNING\"\n    }\n    \"\"\"\n\n  /**\n   * An Actor that forwards every message to a next Actor\n   */\n  class ForwardingActor(next: ActorRef) extends Actor {\n    def receive = {\n      case msg => next ! msg\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * An Actor that only forwards certain messages to a next Actor\n   */\n  class FilteringActor(next: ActorRef) extends Actor {\n    def receive = {\n      case msg: String => next ! msg\n      case _           => None\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * An actor that sends a sequence of messages with a random head list, an\n   * interesting value and a random tail list.

This restriction impedes unit testing, which led to the inception of the TestActorRef.

Then the abstract MultiNodeSpec, which takes the MultiNodeConfig as constructor parameter. copysourceimport org.apache.pekko\nimport pekko.remote.testkit.MultiNodeSpec\nimport pekko.testkit.ImplicitSender\nimport org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll\nimport org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers\nimport org.scalatest.wordspec.AnyWordSpecLike\n\nabstract class StatsSampleSpec\n    extends MultiNodeSpec(StatsSampleSpecConfig)\n    with AnyWordSpecLike\n    with Matchers\n    with BeforeAndAfterAll\n    with ImplicitSender {\n\n  import StatsSampleSpecConfig._\n\n  override def initialParticipants = roles.size\n\n  override def beforeAll() = multiNodeSpecBeforeAll()\n\n  override def afterAll() = multiNodeSpecAfterAll()\n Most of this can be extracted to a separate trait to avoid repeating this in all your tests. Typically you begin your test by starting up the cluster and let the members join, and create some actors. That can be done like this: copysource\"illustrate how to startup cluster\" in within(15 seconds) {\n  Cluster(system).subscribe(testActor, classOf[MemberUp])\n  expectMsgClass(classOf[CurrentClusterState])\n\n  val firstAddress = node(first).address\n  val secondAddress = node(second).address\n  val thirdAddress = node(third).address\n\n  Cluster(system).join(firstAddress)\n\n  system.actorOf(Props[StatsWorker](), \"statsWorker\")\n  system.actorOf(Props[StatsService](), \"statsService\")\n\n  receiveN(3).collect { case MemberUp(m) => m.address }.toSet should be(\n    Set(firstAddress, secondAddress, thirdAddress))\n\n  Cluster(system).unsubscribe(testActor)\n\n  testConductor.enter(\"all-up\")\n} From the test you interact with the cluster using the Cluster extension, e.g. join. copysourceCluster(system).join(firstAddress) Notice how the testActor from testkit is added as subscriber to cluster changes and then waiting for certain events, such as in this case all members becoming ‘Up’. The above code was running for all roles (JVMs). runOn is a convenient utility to declare that a certain block of code should only run for a specific role. copysource\"show usage of the statsService from one node\" in within(15 seconds) {\n  runOn(second) {\n    assertServiceOk()\n  }\n\n  testConductor.enter(\"done-2\")\n}\n\ndef assertServiceOk(): Unit = {\n  val service = system.actorSelection(node(third) / \"user\" / \"statsService\")\n  // eventually the service should be ok,\n  // first attempts might fail because worker actors not started yet\n  awaitAssert {\n    service ! StatsJob(\"this is the text that will be analyzed\")\n    expectMsgType[StatsResult](1.second).meanWordLength should be(3.875 +- 0.001)\n  }\n\n} Once again we take advantage of the facilities in testkit to verify expected behavior. Here using testActor as sender (via ImplicitSender) and verifying the reply with expectMsgType. In the above code you can see node(third), which is useful facility to get the root actor reference of the actor system for a specific role. This can also be used to grab the actor.Address of that node. copysourceval firstAddress = node(first).address\nval secondAddress = node(second).address\nval thirdAddress = node(third).address\nCurrently testing with the sbt-multi-jvm plugin is only documented for Scala.

Pekko Classic is still fully supported and existing applications can continue to use the classic APIs. It is also possible to use the new Actor APIs together with classic actors in the same ActorSystem, see coexistence. For new projects we recommend using the new Actor API.\nFor the full documentation of this feature and for new projects see routers.\nAll routers can be made aware of member nodes in the cluster, i.e. deploying new routees or looking up routees on nodes in the cluster. When a node becomes unreachable or leaves the cluster the routees of that node are automatically unregistered from the router. When new nodes join the cluster, additional routees are added to the router, according to the configuration. Routees are also added when a node becomes reachable again, after having been unreachable.\nCluster aware routers make use of members with status WeaklyUp if that feature is enabled.\nThere are two distinct types of routers.\nGroup - router that sends messages to the specified path using actor selection The routees can be shared among routers running on different nodes in the cluster. One example of a use case for this type of router is a service running on some backend nodes in the cluster and used by routers running on front-end nodes in the cluster. Pool - router that creates routees as child actors and deploys them on remote nodes. Each router will have its own routee instances. For example, if you start a router on 3 nodes in a 10-node cluster, you will have 30 routees in total if the router is configured to use one instance per node. The routees created by the different routers will not be shared among the routers. One example of a use case for this type of router is a single master that coordinates jobs and delegates the actual work to routees running on other nodes in the cluster.","title":"Classic Cluster Aware Routers"},{"location":"/cluster-routing.html#dependency","text":"To use Cluster aware routers, you must add the following dependency in your project:\nsbt val PekkoVersion = \"0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"org.apache.pekko\" %% \"pekko-cluster\" % PekkoVersion Maven <properties>\n  <scala.binary.version>2.13</scala.binary.version>\n</properties>\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n      <artifactId>pekko-bom_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n      <version>0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.pekko</groupId>\n    <artifactId>pekko-cluster_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies> Gradle def versions = [\n  ScalaBinary: \"2.13\"\n]\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.apache.pekko:pekko-bom_${versions.ScalaBinary}:0.0.0+26605-0f20b284+20230301-2309-SNAPSHOT\")\n\n  implementation \"org.apache.pekko:pekko-cluster_${versions.ScalaBinary}\"\n}","title":"Dependency"},{"location":"/cluster-routing.html#router-with-group-of-routees","text":"When using a Group you must start the routee actors on the cluster member nodes.

The path should not contain protocol and address information because they are retrieved dynamically from the cluster membership.

It manages one singleton actor instance among all cluster nodes or a group of nodes tagged with a specific role. ClusterSingletonManager is an actor that is supposed to be started as early as possible on all nodes, or all nodes with specified role, in the cluster. The actual singleton actor is started by the ClusterSingletonManager on the oldest node by creating a child actor from supplied Props. ClusterSingletonManager makes sure that at most one singleton instance is running at any point in time.\nYou can access the singleton actor by using the provided org.apache.pekko.cluster.singleton.ClusterSingletonProxy, which will route all messages to the current instance of the singleton. The proxy will keep track of the oldest node in the cluster and resolve the singleton’s ActorRef by explicitly sending the singleton’s actorSelection the org.apache.pekko.actor.Identify message and waiting for it to reply. This is performed periodically if the singleton doesn’t reply within a certain (configurable) time. Given the implementation, there might be periods of time during which the ActorRef is unavailable, e.g., when a node leaves the cluster. In these cases, the proxy will buffer the messages sent to the singleton and then deliver them when the singleton is finally available. If the buffer is full the ClusterSingletonProxy will drop old messages when new messages are sent via the proxy. The size of the buffer is configurable and it can be disabled by using a buffer size of 0.\nSee Cluster Singleton - Potential problems to be aware of.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/cluster-singleton.html#an-example","text":"Assume that we need one single entry point to an external system. An actor that receives messages from a JMS queue with the strict requirement that only one JMS consumer must exist to make sure that the messages are processed in order. That is perhaps not how one would like to design things, but a typical real-world scenario when integrating with external systems.\nBefore explaining how to create a cluster singleton actor, let’s define message classes and their corresponding factory methods which will be used by the singleton.\nScala copysourceobject PointToPointChannel {\n  case object UnregistrationOk extends CborSerializable\n}\nobject Consumer {\n  case object End extends CborSerializable\n  case object GetCurrent extends CborSerializable\n  case object Ping extends CborSerializable\n  case object Pong extends CborSerializable\n} Java copysourcepublic class TestSingletonMessages {\n  public static class UnregistrationOk {}\n\n  public static class End {}\n\n  public static class Ping {}\n\n  public static class Pong {}\n\n  public static class GetCurrent {}\n\n  public static UnregistrationOk unregistrationOk() {\n    return new UnregistrationOk();\n  }\n\n  public static End end() {\n    return new End();\n  }\n\n  public static Ping ping() {\n    return new Ping();\n  }\n\n  public static Pong pong() {\n    return new Pong();\n  }\n\n  public static GetCurrent getCurrent() {\n    return new GetCurrent();\n  }\n}\nOn each node in the cluster you need to start the ClusterSingletonManager and supply the Props of the singleton actor, in this case the JMS queue consumer.\nScala copysourcesystem.actorOf(\n  ClusterSingletonManager.props(\n    singletonProps = Props(classOf[Consumer], queue, testActor),\n    terminationMessage = End,\n    settings = ClusterSingletonManagerSettings(system).withRole(\"worker\")),\n  name = \"consumer\") Java copysourcefinal ClusterSingletonManagerSettings settings =\n    ClusterSingletonManagerSettings.create(system).withRole(\"worker\");\n\nsystem.actorOf(\n    ClusterSingletonManager.props(\n        Props.create(Consumer.class, () -> new Consumer(queue, testActor)),\n        TestSingletonMessages.end(),\n        settings),\n    \"consumer\");\nHere we limit the singleton to nodes tagged with the \"worker\" role, but all nodes, independent of role, can be used by not specifying withRole.\nWe use an application specific terminationMessage (i.e. TestSingletonMessages.end() message) to be able to close the resources before actually stopping the singleton actor. Note that PoisonPill is a perfectly fine terminationMessage if you only need to stop the actor.\nHere is how the singleton actor handles the terminationMessage in this example.\nScala copysourcecase End =>\n  queue ! UnregisterConsumer\ncase UnregistrationOk =>\n  stoppedBeforeUnregistration = false\n  context.stop(self)\ncase Ping =>\n  sender() !

It only needs to know the location of one (or more) nodes to use as initial contact points. It will establish a connection to a ClusterReceptionistClusterReceptionist somewhere in the cluster. It will monitor the connection to the receptionist and establish a new connection if the link goes down. When looking for a new receptionist it uses fresh contact points retrieved from the previous establishment, or periodically refreshed contacts, i.e. not necessarily the initial contact points.\nUsing the ClusterClientClusterClient for communicating with a cluster from the outside requires that the system with the client can both connect and be connected with Pekko Remoting from all the nodes in the cluster with a receptionist. This creates a tight coupling in that the client and cluster systems may need to have the same version of both Pekko, libraries, message classes, serializers and potentially even the JVM. In many cases it is a better solution to use a more explicit and decoupling protocol such as HTTP or gRPC.\nAdditionally, since Pekko Remoting is primarily designed as a protocol for Pekko Cluster there is no explicit resource management, when a ClusterClientClusterClient has been used it will cause connections with the cluster until the ActorSystem is stopped (unlike other kinds of network clients).\nClusterClientClusterClient should not be used when sending messages to actors that run within the same cluster. Similar functionality as the ClusterClientClusterClient is provided more efficiently by Distributed Publish Subscribe in Cluster for actors that belong to the same cluster.\nThe connecting system must have its org.apache.pekko.actor.provider set to remote or cluster when using the cluster client.\nThe receptionist is supposed to be started on all nodes, or all nodes with a specified role, in the cluster. The receptionist can be started with the ClusterReceptionistClusterReceptionist extension or as an ordinary actor.\nYou can send messages via the ClusterClientClusterClient to any actor in the cluster that is registered in the DistributedPubSubMediatorDistributedPubSubMediator used by the ClusterReceptionistClusterReceptionist. The ClusterClientReceptionistClusterClientReceptionist provides methods for registration of actors that should be reachable from the client. Messages are wrapped in ClusterClient.Send, `ClusterClient.SendToAll`ClusterClient.SendToAll or `ClusterClient.Publish`ClusterClient.Publish.\nBoth the ClusterClientClusterClient and the ClusterClientReceptionistClusterClientReceptionist emit events that can be subscribed to. The ClusterClientClusterClient sends out notifications about the list of contact points received from the ClusterClientReceptionistClusterClientReceptionist. One use of this list might be for the client to record its contact points. A client that is restarted could then use this information to supersede any previously configured contact points.\nThe ClusterClientReceptionistClusterClientReceptionist sends out notifications in relation to having received a contact from a ClusterClientClusterClient. This notification enables the server containing the receptionist to become aware of what clients are connected to.\nClusterClient.Send\nThe message will be delivered to one recipient with a matching path if any such exists. If several entries match the path the message will be delivered to one random destination. The sender of the message can specify that local affinity is preferred, i.e. the message is sent to an actor in the same local actor system as the used receptionist actor, if any such exists, otherwise random to any other matching entry.\nClusterClient.SendToAll\nThe message will be delivered to all recipients with a matching path.\nClusterClient.Publish\nThe message will be delivered to all recipients Actors that have been registered as subscribers to the named topic.\nResponse messages from the destination actor are tunneled via the receptionist to avoid inbound connections from other cluster nodes to the client:\n`sender()``getSender()`, as seen by the destination actor, is not the client itself, but the receptionist `sender()` `getSender()` of the response messages, sent back from the destination and seen by the client, is deadLetters\nsince the client should normally send subsequent messages via the ClusterClientClusterClient. It is possible to pass the original sender inside the reply messages if the client is supposed to communicate directly to the actor in the cluster.\nWhile establishing a connection to a receptionist the ClusterClientClusterClient will buffer messages and send them when the connection is established. If the buffer is full the ClusterClientClusterClient will drop old messages when new messages are sent via the client. The size of the buffer is configurable and it can be disabled by using a buffer size of 0.\nIt’s worth noting that messages can always be lost because of the distributed nature of these actors. As always, additional logic should be implemented in the destination (acknowledgement) and in the client (retry) actors to ensure at-least-once message delivery.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/cluster-client.html#an-example","text":"On the cluster nodes, first start the receptionist.

It does not have to be a persistent actor, but in case of failure or migration of entities between nodes it must be able to recover its state if it is valuable.\nNote how the persistenceId is defined. The name of the actor is the entity identifier (utf-8 URL-encoded). You may define it another way, but it must be unique.\nWhen using the sharding extension you are first, typically at system startup on each node in the cluster, supposed to register the supported entity types with the ClusterSharding.start method. ClusterSharding.start gives you the reference which you can pass along. Please note that ClusterSharding.start will start a ShardRegion in proxy only mode when there is no match between the roles of the current cluster node and the role specified in ClusterShardingSettings.\nScala copysourceval counterRegion: ActorRef = ClusterSharding(system).start(\n  typeName = \"Counter\",\n  entityProps = Props[Counter](),\n  settings = ClusterShardingSettings(system),\n  extractEntityId = extractEntityId,\n  extractShardId = extractShardId) Java copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.japi.Option;\nimport org.apache.pekko.cluster.sharding.ClusterSharding;\nimport org.apache.pekko.cluster.sharding.ClusterShardingSettings;\n\nOption<String> roleOption = Option.none();\nClusterShardingSettings settings = ClusterShardingSettings.create(system);\nActorRef startedCounterRegion =\n    ClusterSharding.get(system)\n        .start(\"Counter\", Props.create(Counter.class), settings, messageExtractor);\nThe extractEntityId and extractShardId are two messageExtractor defines application specific functions methods to extract the entity identifier and the shard identifier from incoming messages.\nScala copysourceval extractEntityId: ShardRegion.ExtractEntityId = {\n  case EntityEnvelope(id, payload) => (id.toString, payload)\n  case msg @ Get(id)               => (id.toString, msg)\n}\n\nval numberOfShards = 100\n\nval extractShardId: ShardRegion.ExtractShardId = {\n  case EntityEnvelope(id, _)       => (id % numberOfShards).toString\n  case Get(id)                     => (id % numberOfShards).toString\n  case ShardRegion.StartEntity(id) =>\n    // StartEntity is used by remembering entities feature\n    (id.toLong % numberOfShards).toString\n  case _ => throw new IllegalArgumentException()\n} Java copysourceimport org.apache.pekko.cluster.sharding.ShardRegion;\n\nShardRegion.MessageExtractor messageExtractor =\n    new ShardRegion.MessageExtractor() {\n\n      @Override\n      public String entityId(Object message) {\n        if (message instanceof Counter.EntityEnvelope)\n          return String.valueOf(((Counter.EntityEnvelope) message).id);\n        else if (message instanceof Counter.Get)\n          return String.valueOf(((Counter.Get) message).counterId);\n        else return null;\n      }\n\n      @Override\n      public Object entityMessage(Object message) {\n        if (message instanceof Counter.EntityEnvelope)\n          return ((Counter.EntityEnvelope) message).payload;\n        else return message;\n      }\n\n      @Override\n      public String shardId(Object message) {\n        int numberOfShards = 100;\n        if (message instanceof Counter.EntityEnvelope) {\n          long id = ((Counter.EntityEnvelope) message).id;\n          return String.valueOf(id % numberOfShards);\n        } else if (message instanceof Counter.Get) {\n          long id = ((Counter.Get) message).counterId;\n          return String.valueOf(id % numberOfShards);\n        } else {\n          return null;\n        }\n      }\n    };\nThis example illustrates two different ways to define the entity identifier in the messages:\nThe Get message includes the identifier itself. The EntityEnvelope holds the identifier, and the actual message that is sent to the entity actor is wrapped in the envelope.\nNote how these two messages types are handled in the extractEntityId function entityId and entityMessage methods shown above. The message sent to the entity actor is the second part of the tuple returned by the extractEntityId what entityMessage returns and that makes it possible to unwrap envelopes if needed.\nA shard is a group of entities that will be managed together. The grouping is defined by the extractShardId function shown above. For a specific entity identifier the shard identifier must always be the same. Otherwise the entity actor might accidentally be started in several places at the same time.\nCreating a good sharding algorithm is an interesting challenge in itself. Try to produce a uniform distribution, i.e. same amount of entities in each shard. As a rule of thumb, the number of shards should be a factor ten greater than the planned maximum number of cluster nodes. Fewer shards than number of nodes will result in that some nodes will not host any shards. Too many shards will result in less efficient management of the shards, e.g. rebalancing overhead, and increased latency because the coordinator is involved in the routing of the first message for each shard. The sharding algorithm must be the same on all nodes in a running cluster. It can be changed after stopping all nodes in the cluster.\nA simple sharding algorithm that works fine in most cases is to take the absolute value of the hashCode of the entity identifier modulo number of shards. As a convenience this is provided by the ShardRegion.HashCodeMessageExtractor.\nMessages to the entities are always sent via the local ShardRegion. The ShardRegion actor reference for a named entity type is returned by ClusterSharding.start and it can also be retrieved with ClusterSharding.shardRegion. The ShardRegion will lookup the location of the shard for the entity if it does not already know its location. It will delegate the message to the right node and it will create the entity actor on demand, i.e. when the first message for a specific entity is delivered.\nScala copysourceval counterRegion: ActorRef = ClusterSharding(system).shardRegion(\"Counter\")\ncounterRegion !

To support graceful passivation without losing such messages the entity actor can send ShardRegion.Passivate to its parent Shard.

factorial(n: Int): BigInt = {\n    @tailrec def factorialAcc(acc: BigInt, n: Int): BigInt = {\n      if (n <= 1) acc\n      else factorialAcc(acc * n, n - 1)\n    }\n    factorialAcc(BigInt(1), n)\n  }\n\n} Java copysourcepublic class FactorialBackend extends AbstractActor {\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(\n            Integer.class,\n            n -> {\n              CompletableFuture<FactorialResult> result =\n                  CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> factorial(n))\n

factorial(int n) {\n    BigInteger acc = BigInteger.ONE;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n      acc = acc.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(i));\n    }\n    return acc;\n  }\n}\nThe frontend that receives user jobs and delegates to the backends via the router:\nScala copysourceclass FactorialFrontend(upToN: Int, repeat: Boolean) extends Actor with ActorLogging {\n\n  val backend = context.actorOf(FromConfig.props(), name = \"factorialBackendRouter\")\n\n  override def preStart(): Unit = {\n    sendJobs()\n    if (repeat) {\n      context.setReceiveTimeout(10.seconds)\n    }\n  }\n\n  def receive = {\n    case (n: Int, factorial: BigInt) =>\n      if (n == upToN) {\n        log.debug(\"{}! = {}\", n, factorial)\n        if (repeat) sendJobs()\n        else context.stop(self)\n      }\n    case ReceiveTimeout =>\n      log.info(\"Timeout\")\n      sendJobs()\n  }\n\n  def sendJobs(): Unit = {\n    log.info(\"Starting batch of factorials up to [{}]\", upToN)\n    (1 to upToN).foreach { backend ! _ }\n  }\n} Java copysourcepublic class FactorialFrontend extends AbstractActor {\n  final int upToN;\n  final boolean repeat;\n\n  LoggingAdapter log = Logging.getLogger(getContext().getSystem(), this);\n\n  ActorRef backend =\n      getContext().actorOf(FromConfig.getInstance().props(), \"factorialBackendRouter\");\n\n  public FactorialFrontend(int upToN, boolean repeat) {\n    this.upToN = upToN;\n    this.repeat = repeat;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void preStart() {\n    sendJobs();\n    getContext().setReceiveTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10));\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(\n            FactorialResult.class,\n            result -> {\n              if (result.n == upToN) {\n                log.debug(\"{}! = {}\", result.n, result.factorial);\n                if (repeat) sendJobs();\n                else getContext().stop(getSelf());\n              }\n            })\n        .match(\n            ReceiveTimeout.class,\n            x -> {\n              log.info(\"Timeout\");\n

backend.tell(n, getSelf());\n    }\n  }\n}\nAs you can see, the router is defined in the same way as other routers, and in this case it is configured as follows:\npekko.actor.deployment {\n  /factorialFrontend/factorialBackendRouter = {\n    # Router type provided by metrics extension.\n    router = cluster-metrics-adaptive-group\n    # Router parameter specific for metrics extension.\n

That can be done by first sending a Replicator.GetReplicator.Get with Replicator.ReadMajorityReplicator.ReadMajority and then continue with the Replicator.UpdateReplicator.Update when the Replicator.GetSuccessReplicator.GetSuccess, Replicator.GetFailureReplicator.GetFailure or Replicator.NotFoundReplicator.NotFound reply is received. This might be needed when you need to base a decision on latest information or when removing entries from an ORSetORSet or ORMapORMap. If an entry is added to an ORSet or ORMap from one node and removed from another node the entry will only be removed if the added entry is visible on the node where the removal is performed (hence the name observed-removed set).\nThe following example illustrates how to do that:\nScala copysourcedef receiveRemoveItem: Receive = {\n  case cmd @ RemoveItem(productId) =>\n    // Try to fetch latest from a majority of nodes first, since ORMap\n    // remove must have seen the item to be able to remove it.\n    replicator !

Update(DataKey, LWWMap(), writeMajority, None) {\n      _.remove(node, productId)\n    }\n\n  case NotFound(DataKey, Some(RemoveItem(productId))) =>\n  // nothing to remove\n} Java copysourceprivate void receiveRemoveItem(RemoveItem rm) {\n  // Try to fetch latest from a majority of nodes first, since ORMap\n  // remove must have seen the item to be able to remove it.\n  Optional<Object> ctx = Optional.of(rm);\n  replicator.tell(\n      new Replicator.Get<LWWMap<String, LineItem>>(dataKey, readMajority, ctx), getSelf());\n}\n\nprivate void receiveRemoveItemGetSuccess(GetSuccess<LWWMap<String, LineItem>> g) {\n  RemoveItem rm = (RemoveItem) g.getRequest().get();\n  removeItem(rm.productId);\n}\n\nprivate void receiveRemoveItemGetFailure(GetFailure<LWWMap<String, LineItem>> f) {\n  // ReadMajority failed, fall back to best effort local value\n  RemoveItem rm = (RemoveItem) f.getRequest().get();\n  removeItem(rm.productId);\n}\n\nprivate void removeItem(String productId) {\n  Update<LWWMap<String, LineItem>> update =\n      new Update<>(dataKey, LWWMap.create(), writeMajority, cart -> cart.remove(node, productId));\n  replicator.tell(update, getSelf());\n}\n\nprivate boolean isResponseToRemoveItem(GetResponse<?> response) {\n  return response.key().equals(dataKey)\n      && (response.getRequest().orElse(null) instanceof RemoveItem);\n}\nWarning Caveat: Even if you use WriteMajority and ReadMajority there is small risk that you may read stale data if the cluster membership has changed between the Update and the Get. For example, in cluster of 5 nodes when you Update and that change is written to 3 nodes: n1, n2, n3. Then 2 more nodes are added and a Get request is reading from 4 nodes, which happens to be n4, n5, n6, n7, i.e. the value on n1, n2, n3 is not seen in the response of the Get request.","title":"Consistency"},{"location":"/distributed-data.html#delete","text":"For the full documentation of this feature and for new projects see Distributed Data - Delete.\nScala copysourceval replicator = DistributedData(system).replicator\nval Counter1Key = PNCounterKey(\"counter1\")\nval Set2Key = ORSetKey[String](\"set2\")\n\nreplicator !

Sending messages to a reference pointing the old actor will not be delivered to the new actor. If you don’t want this behavior, e.g. in case of long term storage of the reference, you can use toStringWithAddress, which doesn’t include the unique id.\nThere is also a default remote address which is the one used by cluster support (and typical systems have just this one); you can get it like this:\nScala copysourceval selfAddress = Cluster(system).selfAddress\n\nval serializedRef: String =\n  theActorRef.path.toSerializationFormatWithAddress(selfAddress) Java copysourceAddress selfAddress = Cluster.get(system).selfAddress();\n\nString serializedRef = theActorRef.path().toSerializationFormatWithAddress(selfAddress);","title":"Serializing ActorRefs"},{"location":"/index-network.html","text":"","title":"Classic Networking"},{"location":"/index-network.html#classic-networking","text":"Note Pekko Classic pertains to the original Actor APIs, which have been improved by more type safe and guided Actor APIs.

Every I/O driver (TCP, UDP) has a special actor, called a manager that serves as an entry point for the API. I/O is broken into several drivers. The manager for a particular driver is accessible through the IO entry pointby querying an ActorSystem.

The worker actors present themselves to the API user in the reply to the command that was sent.

These worker actors watch their listener counterparts. If the listener stops then the worker will automatically release any resources that it holds. This design makes the API more robust against resource leaks.\nThanks to the completely actor based approach of the I/O API the opposite direction works as well: a user actor responsible for handling a connection can watch the connection actor to be notified if it unexpectedly terminates.","title":"DeathWatch and Resource Management"},{"location":"/io.html#write-models-ack-nack-","text":"I/O devices have a maximum throughput which limits the frequency and size of writes. When an application tries to push more data than a device can handle, the driver has to buffer bytes until the device is able to write them. With buffering it is possible to handle short bursts of intensive writes — but no buffer is infinite. “Flow control” is needed to avoid overwhelming device buffers.\nPekko supports two types of flow control:\nAck-based, where the driver notifies the writer when writes have succeeded. Nack-based, where the driver notifies the writer when writes have failed.\nEach of these models is available in both the TCP and the UDP implementations of Pekko I/O.\nIndividual writes can be acknowledged by providing an ack object in the write message (WriteWrite in the case of TCP and SendSend for UDP). When the write is complete the worker will send the ack object to the writing actor. This can be used to implement ack-based flow control; sending new data only when old data has been acknowledged.\nIf a write (or any other command) fails, the driver notifies the actor that sent the command with a special message (CommandFailed in the case of UDP and TCP). This message will also notify the writer of a failed write, serving as a nack for that write. Please note, that in a nack-based flow-control setting the writer has to be prepared for the fact that the failed write might not be the most recent write it sent. For example, the failure notification for a write W1 might arrive after additional write commands W2 and W3 have been sent. If the writer wants to resend any nacked messages it may need to keep a buffer of pending messages.\nWarning An acknowledged write does not mean acknowledged delivery or storage; receiving an ack for a write signals that the I/O driver has successfully processed the write. The Ack/Nack protocol described here is a means of flow control not error handling. In other words, data may still be lost, even if every write is acknowledged.","title":"Write models (Ack, Nack)"},{"location":"/io.html#bytestring","text":"To maintain isolation, actors should communicate with immutable objects only. ByteStringByteString is an immutable container for bytes. It is used by Pekko’s I/O system as an efficient, immutable alternative the traditional byte containers used for I/O on the JVM, such as Array[Byte]byte[] and ByteBuffer.\nByteString is a rope-like data structure that is immutable and provides fast concatenation and slicing operations (perfect for I/O). When two ByteStrings are concatenated together they are both stored within the resulting ByteString instead of copying both to a new Arrayarray. Operations such as dropdrop and taketake return ByteStrings that still reference the original Arrayarray, but just change the offset and length that is visible. Great care has also been taken to make sure that the internal Arrayarray cannot be modified. Whenever a potentially unsafe Arrayarray is used to create a new ByteString a defensive copy is created. If you require a ByteString that only blocks as much memory as necessary for its content, use the compactcompact method to get a CompactByteStringCompactByteString instance. If the ByteString represented only a slice of the original array, this will result in copying all bytes in that slice.\nByteString inherits all methods from IndexedSeq, and it also has some new ones. For more information, look up the util.ByteStringutil.ByteString class and its companion object in the ScalaDoc.\nByteString also comes with its own optimized builder and iterator classes ByteStringBuilderByteStringBuilder and ByteIteratorByteIterator which provide extra features in addition to those of normal builders and iterators.","title":"ByteString"},{"location":"/io.html#compatibility-with-java-io","text":"A ByteStringBuilderByteStringBuilder can be wrapped in a java.io.OutputStream via the asOutputStreamasOutputStream method.

This “manager” accepts requests for establishing a communications channel (e.g. connect or listen on a TCP socket). Each communications channel is represented by one dedicated actor, which is exposed to client code for all interaction with this channel over its entire lifetime.\nThe central element of the implementation is the transport-specific “selector” actor; in the case of TCP this would wrap a java.nio.channels.Selector. The channel actors register their interest in readability or writability of their channel by sending corresponding messages to their assigned selector actor. However, the actual channel reading and writing is performed by the channel actors themselves, which frees the selector actors from time-consuming tasks and thereby ensures low latency. The selector actor’s only responsibility is the management of the underlying selector’s key set and the actual select operation, which is the only operation to typically block.\nThe assignment of channels to selectors is performed by the manager actor and remains unchanged for the entire lifetime of a channel. Thereby the management actor “stripes” new channels across one or more selector actors based on some implementation-specific distribution logic. This logic may be delegated (in part) to the selectors actors, which could, for example, choose to reject the assignment of a new channel when they consider themselves to be at capacity.\nThe manager actor creates (and therefore supervises) the selector actors, which in turn create and supervise their channel actors. The actor hierarchy of one single transport implementation therefore consists of three distinct actor levels, with the management actor at the top-, the channel actors at the leaf- and the selector actors at the mid-level.\nBack-pressure for output is enabled by allowing the user to specify within its Write messages whether it wants to receive an acknowledgement for enqueuing that write to the O/S kernel. Back-pressure for input is enabled by sending the channel actor a message which temporarily disables read interest for the channel until reading is re-enabled with a corresponding resume command. In the case of transports with flow control—like TCP—the act of not consuming data at the receiving end (thereby causing them to remain in the kernels read buffers) is propagated back to the sender, linking these two mechanisms across the network.","title":"Basic Architecture"},{"location":"/common/io-layer.html#design-benefits","text":"Staying within the actor model for the whole implementation allows us to remove the need for explicit thread handling logic, and it also means that there are no locks involved (besides those which are part of the underlying transport library).

In fact the event-based nature of I/O maps so well to the actor model that we expect clear performance and especially scalability benefits over traditional solutions with explicit thread management and synchronization.\nAnother benefit of supervision hierarchies is that clean-up of resources comes naturally: shutting down a selector actor will automatically clean up all channel actors, allowing proper closing of the channels and sending the appropriate messages to user-level client actors. DeathWatch allows the channel actors to notice the demise of their user-level handler actors and terminate in an orderly fashion in that case as well; this naturally reduces the chances of leaking open channels.\nThe choice of using ActorRefActorRef for exposing all functionality entails that these references can be distributed or delegated freely and in general handled as the user sees fit, including the use of remoting and life-cycle monitoring (just to name two).","title":"Design Benefits"},{"location":"/common/io-layer.html#how-to-go-about-adding-a-new-transport","text":"The best start is to study the TCP reference implementation to get a good grip on the basic working principle and then design an implementation, which is similar in spirit, but adapted to the new protocol in question.

This setting disables Nagle’s algorithm, considerably improving latency for most applications. This setting could be overridden by passing SO.TcpNoDelay(false) in the list of socket options of the Connect messagemessage by the TcpMessage.connect method.\nThe TCP manager will then reply either with a CommandFailed or it will spawn an internal actor representing the new connection. This new actor will then send a Connected message to the original sender of the Connect messagemessage by the TcpMessage.connect method.\nIn order to activate the new connection a Register messagemessage by the TcpMessage.register method must be sent to the connection actor, informing that one about who shall receive data from the socket. Before this step is done the connection cannot be used, and there is an internal timeout after which the connection actor will shut itself down if no Register messagemessage by the TcpMessage.register method message is received.\nThe connection actor watches the registered handler and closes the connection when that one terminates, thereby cleaning up all internal resources associated with that connection.\nThe actor in the example above uses become to switch from unconnected to connected operation, demonstrating the commands and events which are observed in that state. For a discussion on CommandFailed see Throttling Reads and Writes below. ConnectionClosed is a trait, which marks the different connection close events. The last line handles all connection close events in the same way.

Tcp.WriteCommand is an abstract class with three concrete implementations:\nTcp.Write The simplest WriteCommand implementation which wraps a ByteString instance and an “ack” event. A ByteString (as explained in this section) models one or more chunks of immutable in-memory data with a maximum (total) size of 2 GB (2^31 bytes). Tcp.WriteFile If you want to send “raw” data from a file you can do so efficiently with the Tcp.WriteFile command. This allows you do designate a (contiguous) chunk of on-disk bytes for sending across the connection without the need to first load them into the JVM memory. As such Tcp.WriteFile can “hold” more than 2GB of data and an “ack” event if required. Tcp.CompoundWrite Sometimes, you might want to group (or interleave) several Tcp.Write and/or Tcp.WriteFile commands into one atomic write command which gets written to the connection in one go. The Tcp.CompoundWrite allows you to do just that and offers three benefits:\nAs explained in the following section the TCP connection actor can only handle one single write command at a time. By combining several writes into one CompoundWrite you can have them be sent across the connection with minimum overhead and without the need to spoon feed them to the connection actor via an ACK-based message protocol. Because a WriteCommand is atomic you can be sure that no other actor can “inject” other writes into your series of writes if you combine them into one single CompoundWrite. In scenarios where several actors write to the same connection this can be an important feature which can be somewhat hard to achieve otherwise. The “sub writes” of a CompoundWrite are regular Write or WriteFile commandsmessages by TcpMessage.write or TcpMessage.writeFile methods that themselves can request “ack” events. These ACKs are sent out as soon as the respective “sub write” has been completed. This allows you to attach more than one ACK to a Write or WriteFilemessage by TcpMessage.write or TcpMessage.writeFile (by combining it with an empty write that itself requests an ACK) or to have the connection actor acknowledge the progress of transmitting the CompoundWrite by sending out intermediate ACKs at arbitrary points.","title":"Writing to a connection"},{"location":"/io-tcp.html#throttling-reads-and-writes","text":"The basic model of the TCP connection actor is that it has no internal buffering (i.e. it can only process one write at a time, meaning it can buffer one write until it has been passed on to the O/S kernel in full). Congestion needs to be handled at the user level, for both writes and reads.\nFor back-pressuring writes there are three modes of operation\nACK-based: every Write command carries an arbitrary object, and if this object is not Tcp.NoAck then it will be returned to the sender of the Write upon successfully writing all contained data to the socket. If no other write is initiated before having received this acknowledgement then no failures can happen due to buffer overrun. NACK-based: every write which arrives while a previous write is not yet completed will be replied to with a CommandFailed message containing the failed write. Just relying on this mechanism requires the implemented protocol to tolerate skipping writes (e.g. if each write is a valid message on its own and it is not required that all are delivered). This mode is enabled by setting the useResumeWriting flag to false within the Register messagemessage by the TcpMessage.register method during connection activation. NACK-based with write suspending: this mode is very similar to the NACK-based one, but once a single write has failed no further writes will succeed until a ResumeWriting messagemessage by the TcpMessage.resumeWriting method is received. This message will be answered with a WritingResumed message once the last accepted write has completed. If the actor driving the connection implements buffering and resends the NACK’ed messages after having awaited the WritingResumed signal then every message is delivered exactly once to the network socket.\nThese write back-pressure models (with the exception of the second which is rather specialised) are demonstrated in complete examples below. The full and contiguous source is available on GitHubon GitHub.\nFor back-pressuring reads there are two modes of operation\nPush-reading: in this mode the connection actor sends the registered reader actor incoming data as soon as available as Received events. Whenever the reader actor wants to signal back-pressure to the remote TCP endpoint it can send a SuspendReading messagemessage by the TcpMessage.suspendReading method to the connection actor to indicate that it wants to suspend the reception of new data. No Received events will arrive until a corresponding ResumeReading is sent indicating that the receiver actor is ready again. Pull-reading: after sending a Received event the connection actor automatically suspends accepting data from the socket until the reader actor signals with a ResumeReading message that it is ready to process more input data.

This will lead to no data being read from the socket anymore (although this does happen after a delay because it takes some time until the connection actor processes this command, hence appropriate head-room in the buffer should be present), which in turn will lead to the O/S kernel buffer filling up on our end, then the TCP window mechanism will stop the remote side from writing, filling up its write buffer, until finally the writer on the other side cannot push any data into the socket anymore. This is how end-to-end back-pressure is realized across a TCP connection.","title":"ACK-Based Write Back-Pressure"},{"location":"/io-tcp.html#nack-based-write-back-pressure-with-suspending","text":"Scala copysourceobject EchoHandler {\n  final case class Ack(offset: Int) extends Tcp.Event\n\n  def props(connection: ActorRef, remote: InetSocketAddress): Props =\n    Props(classOf[EchoHandler], connection, remote)\n}\n\nclass EchoHandler(connection: ActorRef, remote: InetSocketAddress) extends Actor with ActorLogging {\n\n  import Tcp._\n  import EchoHandler._\n\n  // sign death pact: this actor terminates when connection breaks\n  context.watch(connection)\n\n  // start out in optimistic write-through mode\n  def receive = writing\n\n  def writing: Receive = {\n    case Received(data) =>\n      connection !

That latter message is sent by the connection actor only once the internally queued write has been fully completed, meaning that a subsequent write will not fail. This is exploited by the EchoHandler to switch to an ACK-based approach for the first ten writes after a failure before resuming the optimistic write-through behavior.\nScala copysourcedef closing: Receive = {\n  case CommandFailed(_: Write) =>\n    connection !

In the case of the previous Echo server example this meant that we needed to maintain a buffer of incoming data to keep it around since the rate of writing might be slower than the rate of the arrival of new data.\nWith the Pull mode this buffer can be completely eliminated as the following snippet demonstrates:\nScala copysourceoverride def preStart(): Unit = connection !

Every pull mode connection actor starts from suspended state. To start the flow of data we send a ResumeReadingmessage by the TcpMessage.resumeReading method in the preStart method to tell the connection actor that we are ready to receive the first chunk of data. Since we only resume reading when the previous data chunk has been completely written there is no need for maintaining a buffer.\nTo enable pull reading on an outbound connection the pullMode parameter of the ConnectTcpMessage.connect method should be set to true:\nScala copysourceIO(Tcp) !

The UDP extension is queried using the SimpleSenderUdpMessage.simpleSender message, which is answered by a SimpleSenderReady notification. The sender of this message is the newly created sender actor which from this point onward can be used to send datagrams to arbitrary destinations; in this example it will send any UTF-8 encoded String it receives to a predefined remote address.\nNote The simple sender will not shut itself down because it cannot know when you are done with it.

Which port was actually bound can be found out by inspecting the Bound message.\nThe sender of the Bound message is the actor which manages the new socket. Sending datagrams is achieved by using the SendUdpMessage.send message and the socket can be closed by sending a UnbindUdpMessage.unbind message, in which case the socket actor will reply with a Unbound notification.\nReceived datagrams are sent to the actor designated in the Bind message, whereas the Bound message will be sent to the sender of the BindUdpMessage.bind.","title":"Bind (and Send)"},{"location":"/io-udp.html#connected-udp","text":"The service provided by the connection based UDP API is similar to the bind-and-send service we saw earlier, but the main difference is that a connection is only able to send to the remoteAddress it was connected to, and will receive datagrams only from that address.\nScala copysourceclass Connected(remote: InetSocketAddress) extends Actor {\n  import context.system\n  IO(UdpConnected) !

Users should pick one of the built in extensions.\nPekko DNS is a pluggable way to interact with DNS. Implementations much implement org.apache.pekko.io.DnsProvider and provide a configuration block that specifies the implementation via provider-object.\nDNS via Pekko Discovery Pekko Discovery can be backed by the Pekko DNS implementation and provides a more general API for service lookups which is not limited to domain name lookup.\nTo select which DnsProvider to use set pekko.io.dns.resolver to the location of the configuration.\nThere are currently two implementations:\ninet-address - Based on the JDK’s InetAddress. Using this will be subject to both the JVM’s DNS cache and its built in one. async-dns - A native implemention of the DNS protocol that does not use any JDK classes or caches.\ninet-address is the default implementation as it pre-dates async-dns, async-dns will likely become the default in the next major release.\nDNS lookups can be done via the DNS extension:\nScala copysourceval initial: Option[Dns.Resolved] = Dns(system).cache.resolve(\"google.com\")(system, actorRef)\nval cached: Option[Dns.Resolved] = Dns(system).cache.cached(\"google.com\") Java copysourceOption<DnsProtocol.Resolved> initial =\n    Dns.get(system)\n        .cache()\n        .resolve(\n            new DnsProtocol.Resolve(\"google.com\", DnsProtocol.ipRequestType()),\n            system,\n            actorRef);\nOption<DnsProtocol.Resolved> cached =\n    Dns.get(system)\n        .cache()\n        .cached(new DnsProtocol.Resolve(\"google.com\", DnsProtocol.ipRequestType()));\nAlternatively the IO(Dns) actor can be interacted with directly. However this exposes the different protocols of the DNS provider. inet-adddress uses Dns.Resolve and Dns.Resolved where as the async-dns uses DnsProtocol.Resolve and DnsProtocol.Resolved. The reason for the difference is inet-address predates async-dns and async-dns exposes additional information such as SRV records and it wasn’t possible to evolve the original API in a backward compatible way.\nInet-Address API:\nScala copysourceval resolved: Future[Dns.Resolved] = (IO(Dns) ?

Given a simple actor:\ncopysourceimport org.apache.pekko.actor.{ Actor, DeadLetter, Props }\n\nclass DeadLetterListener extends Actor {\n  def receive = {\n    case d: DeadLetter => println(d)\n  }\n}\n\nval listener = system.actorOf(Props[DeadLetterListener]())\nsystem.eventStream.subscribe(listener, classOf[DeadLetter])\ncopysourceimport org.apache.pekko.actor.ActorRef;\nimport org.apache.pekko.actor.ActorSystem; copysourcestatic class DeadLetterActor extends AbstractActor {\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(\n            DeadLetter.class,\n            msg -> {\n              System.out.println(msg);\n            })\n        .build();\n  }\n} it can be subscribed like this: copysourcefinal ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create(\"DeadLetters\");\nfinal ActorRef actor = system.actorOf(Props.create(DeadLetterActor.class));\nsystem.getEventStream().subscribe(actor, DeadLetter.class);\nIt is also worth pointing out that thanks to the way the subchannel classification is implemented in the event stream, it is possible to subscribe to a group of events, by subscribing to their common superclass as demonstrated in the following example:\nScala copysourceabstract class AllKindsOfMusic { def artist: String }\ncase class Jazz(artist: String) extends AllKindsOfMusic\ncase class Electronic(artist: String) extends AllKindsOfMusic\n\nclass Listener extends Actor {\n  def receive = {\n    case m: Jazz       => println(s\"${self.path.name} is listening to: ${m.artist}\")\n    case m: Electronic => println(s\"${self.path.name} is listening to: ${m.artist}\")\n  }\n}\n\nval jazzListener = system.actorOf(Props[Listener]())\nval musicListener = system.actorOf(Props[Listener]())\nsystem.eventStream.subscribe(jazzListener, classOf[Jazz])\nsystem.eventStream.subscribe(musicListener, classOf[AllKindsOfMusic])\n\n// only musicListener gets this message, since it listens to *all* kinds of music:\nsystem.eventStream.publish(Electronic(\"Parov Stelar\"))\n\n// jazzListener and musicListener will be notified about Jazz:\nsystem.eventStream.publish(Jazz(\"Sonny Rollins\")) Java copysourceinterface AllKindsOfMusic {}\n\nclass Jazz implements AllKindsOfMusic {\n  public final String artist;\n\n  public Jazz(String artist) {\n    this.artist = artist;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Electronic implements AllKindsOfMusic {\n  public final String artist;\n\n  public Electronic(String artist) {\n    this.artist = artist;\n  }\n}\n\nstatic class Listener extends AbstractActor {\n  @Override\n  public Receive createReceive() {\n    return receiveBuilder()\n        .match(\n            Jazz.class,\n            msg -> System.out.printf(\"%s is listening to: %s%n\", getSelf().path().name(), msg))\n        .match(\n            Electronic.class,\n            msg -> System.out.printf(\"%s is listening to: %s%n\", getSelf().path().name(), msg))\n        .build();\n  }\n}\n  final ActorRef actor = system.actorOf(Props.create(DeadLetterActor.class));\n  system.getEventStream().subscribe(actor, DeadLetter.class);\n\n  final ActorRef jazzListener = system.actorOf(Props.create(Listener.class));\n  final ActorRef musicListener = system.actorOf(Props.create(Listener.class));\n  system.getEventStream().subscribe(jazzListener, Jazz.class);\n  system.getEventStream().subscribe(musicListener, AllKindsOfMusic.class);\n\n  // only musicListener gets this message, since it listens to *all* kinds of music:\n  system.getEventStream().publish(new Electronic(\"Parov Stelar\"));\n\n  // jazzListener and musicListener will be notified about Jazz:\n  system.getEventStream().publish(new Jazz(\"Sonny Rollins\"));\nSimilarly to Actor Classification, EventStreamEventStream will automatically remove subscribers when they terminate.\nNote The event stream is a local facility, meaning that it will not distribute events to other nodes in a clustered environment (unless you subscribe a Remote Actor to the stream explicitly).

In the demonstrated case, the actor system’s address is included in the pekkoSource representation of the log source (see Logging Thread, Pekko Source and Actor System in MDC), while in the second case this is not automatically done. The second parameter to Logging Logging.getLogger is the source of this logging channel. The source object is translated to a String according to the following rules:\nif it is an Actor or ActorRef, its path is used in case of a String it is used as is in case of a Class an approximation of its simpleName is used in all other cases a compile error occurs unless an implicit LogSource[T] is in scope for the type in question the simpleName of its class is used\nThe log message may contain argument placeholders {}, which will be substituted if the log level is enabled. Compared to constructing a full string for the log message this has the advantage of avoiding superfluous string concatenation and object allocations when the log level is disabled. Giving more arguments than placeholders results in a warning being appended to the log statement (i.e. on the same line with the same severity). You may pass an array as the only substitution argument to have its elements be treated individually:\nScala copysourceval args = Array(\"The\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\", 42)\nsystem.log.debug(\"five parameters: {}, {}, {}, {}, {}\", args) Java copysourcefinal Object[] args = new Object[] {\"The\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\", 42};\nsystem.log().debug(\"five parameters: {}, {}, {}, {}, {}\", args);\nThe Java Class of the log source is also included in the generated Logging.LogEventLogging.LogEvent. In case of a simple string this is replaced with a “marker” class DummyClassForStringSourcesDummyClassForStringSources in order to allow special treatment of this case, e.g. in the SLF4J event listener which will then use the string instead of the class’ name for looking up the logger instance to use.","title":"How to Log"},{"location":"/logging.html#logging-of-dead-letters","text":"By default messages sent to dead letters are logged at INFO level.

Look no further than ActorSystemActorSystem! There you find the schedulergetScheduler() method that returns an instance of SchedulerScheduler, this instance is unique per ActorSystem and is used internally for scheduling things to happen at specific points in time.\nYou can schedule sending of messages to actors and execution of tasks (functions or Runnable). You will get a CancellableCancellable back that you can call cancelcancel() on to cancel the execution of the scheduled operation.\nWhen scheduling periodic or single messages in an actor to itself, it is recommended to use the Actor Timers instead of using the SchedulerScheduler directly.\nThe scheduler in Pekko is designed for high-throughput of thousands up to millions of triggers. The prime use-case being triggering Actor receive timeouts, Future timeouts, circuit breakers and other time dependent events which happen all-the-time and in many instances at the same time. The implementation is based on a Hashed Wheel Timer, which is a known datastructure and algorithm for handling such use cases, refer to the Hashed and Hierarchical Timing Wheels whitepaper by Varghese and Lauck if you’d like to understand its inner workings.\nThe Pekko scheduler is not designed for long-term scheduling (see akka-quartz-scheduler instead for this use case) nor is it to be used for highly precise firing of the events. The maximum amount of time into the future you can schedule an event to trigger is around 8 months, which in practice is too much to be useful since this would assume the system never went down during that period. If you need long-term scheduling we highly recommend looking into alternative schedulers, as this is not the use-case the Pekko scheduler is implemented for.\nWarning The default implementation of SchedulerScheduler used by Pekko is based on job buckets which are emptied according to a fixed schedule. It does not execute tasks at the exact time, but on every tick, it will run everything that is (over)due.

Use scheduleWithFixedDelay. fixed-rate - The frequency of execution over time will meet the given interval. Use scheduleAtFixedRate.\nIf you are uncertain of which one to use you should pick scheduleWithFixedDelay.\nWhen using fixed-delay it will not compensate the delay between tasks or messages if the execution takes long time or if scheduling is delayed longer than specified for some reason. The delay between subsequent execution will always be (at least) the given delay. In the long run, the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified delay.\nFixed-delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require “smoothness.” In other words, it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run.\nWhen using fixed-rate it will compensate the delay for a subsequent task if the previous tasks took too long to execute. For example, if the given interval is 1000 milliseconds and a task takes 200 milliseconds to execute the next task will be scheduled to run after 800 milliseconds. In such cases, the actual execution interval will differ from the interval passed to the scheduleAtFixedRate method.\nIf the execution of the tasks takes longer than the interval, the subsequent execution will start immediately after the prior one completes (there will be no overlap of executions). This also has the consequence that after long garbage collection pauses or other reasons when the JVM was suspended all “missed” tasks will execute when the process wakes up again. For example, scheduleAtFixedRate with an interval of 1 second and the process is suspended for 30 seconds will result in 30 tasks (or messages) being executed in rapid succession to catch up. In the long run, the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of the specified interval.\nFixed-rate execution is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to absolute time or where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important, such as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for ten seconds.\nWarning scheduleAtFixedRate can result in bursts of scheduled tasks or messages after long garbage collection pauses, which may in worst case cause undesired load on the system. scheduleWithFixedDelay is often preferred.","title":"Schedule periodically"},{"location":"/scheduler.html#the-scheduler-interface","text":"The actual scheduler implementation is loaded reflectively upon ActorSystemActorSystem start-up, which means that it is possible to provide a different one using the pekko.scheduler.implementation configuration property.
