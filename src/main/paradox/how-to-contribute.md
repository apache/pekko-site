## Code of Conduct

Please see the Apache wide [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct).

## Committers

The current list of Apache Pekko committers can be found in the Apache [Phonebook](https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?pmc=pekko).

All code merges require approval from at least 1 Pekko committer. Most Pekko committers are also members of the
PPMC. Releases require that at least 3 Pekko PPMC members approve the release.

We are looking to build up the number of committers and PPMC members. We will invite people to join the team. This is based
on meritocracy. Contributors who have become involved in the Pekko community and who have shown a good level of understanding
of the Pekko code base will be considered.
We have an outline of the process for becoming a committer on the Apache Pekko project on our [wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PEKKO/Becoming+a+Committer).

Code reviews and votes on releases can be made by anyone.
